## Releases

### geklojban-1.2.10 August 2020

#### Compiled version
*   read the final document that is to be used for printing and publication. Notice that the title page has the document explicitly marked as "geklojban-1.2.10" and has the name of the organization published it different from the LLG; this is done to emphasize that it's not an LLG publication:
    *   [PDF format](https://lojban.pw/cll/uncll-1.2.10/cll.pdf)
    <!-- *   [EPUB format](https://lojban.pw/cll/uncll-1.2.10/cll.epub) -->
    *   [HTML format, one page is one section of the book](https://lojban.pw/cll/uncll-1.2.10/xhtml_section_chunks/)
    *   [HTML format - the whole book in one very long page](https://lojban.pw/cll/uncll-1.2.10/xhtml_no_chunks/)
* or read the so called ["difference" PDF document](https://lojban.pw/cll/uncll-1.2.10/cll_diffs/cll_difference_prefixed.pdf) that compares geklojban-1.2.10 to the CLL published in 2016 (2016-08-27 release). The document has insertions marked with green and "ins\`" prefix and deletions marked with red and "del\`" prefix. Prefixes are added so that you can use Cmd+F or Ctrl+F to quickly find the differences in the PDF document. There is [an alternative difference version without prefixes](https://lojban.pw/cll/uncll-1.2.10/cll_diffs/cll_difference.pdf) (but then you'll have to manually scroll the document to find the differences).
*   or read the difference document in HTML format instead:
    *   [with prefixes](https://lojban.pw/cll/uncll-1.2.10/cll_diffs/diff_new_xhtml_no_chunks/difference_prefixed.html),

#### Short list of changes compared to the previous version 'geklojban-1.2.8.1 June 2020'

* HTML version now has tables and examples horizontally scrollable on narrow (e.g. mobile devices') screens. This makes the HTML version more mobile-friendly
* EPUB is generated again (was missing from version  1.2.8.1)
* Korean and Chinese symbols are now displayed using Noto CJK font
* places like "x1" are now displayed with numbers subscripted
* An example in Section 16.9 {naku zo'u la djan. klama} didn't correspond to other examples around it so it was replaced with {naku zo'u mi klama le zarci} (a bug noticed by [Corbin Simpson](https://github.com/MostAwesomeDude))
* a definition of the word {bu'u} is added to the list of other grammatical partices of class FAhA

#### Short list of changes compared to the previous version 'geklojban-1.2.7 May 2020'

* A new "diacritic" orthography named "zbalermorna" added. It's clearly mentioned as unofficial. Its symbols ("letters") are displayed with an appropriate font. Kudos to [Jack Humbert](https://jackhumbert.github.io/zbalermorna/) and their team (la saski'o, la xaspeljba and others) for the font and the revision of the explanation of the orthography.
* The indices have been revised (almost all of their 4000 entries). Numerous entries have been modified for the ease of use or moved from Lojban Words Index to General Index or vice versa.
* a better diff algorithm for viewing differences between versions (without extra clutter)
* version 1.2.8.1 hotfix release: fixed problems with zbalermorna symbols display in the PDF document

#### Short list of changes compared to the previous version 'geklojban-1.2.6 April 2020'

* "The cmavo tu'a is used in forming abstractions, and is explained more fully in Section 11.11." but it isn't mentioned at all in that section. Changed the reference to Section 11.10. The bug is noticed by [Robert Baruch](https://github.com/RobertBaruch).
* all the references to selma'o are moved from lojban words index to general index in the appendix.
* Section 10.18. The phrase "Unlike -nai contradictory negation, scalar negation of tenses is not limited to PU and FAhA:" contradicted the following text of the section. Replaced with "An example of scalar negation of FAhA:"
