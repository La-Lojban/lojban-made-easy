## Lesson 1. The language at a glance

### Alphabet

The basic thing you need to know about Lojban is obviously the alphabet.

Lojban uses the Latin alphabet (vowels are colored):

<dl><ddstyle=""><b><font color="#FF1493">a</font> b c d <font color="#FF1493">e</font> f g <font color="#FF1493">i</font> j k l m n <font color="#FF1493">o</font> p r s t <font color="#FF1493">u</font> v x <font color="#FF1493">y</font> z ' .</b></dd></dl>

Letters are pronounced exactly as they are written.

There are six vowels in Lojban:

<table class="wikitable">
<tbody><tr>
<td><b><center><font color="#FF1493">a</font></center></b>
</td>
<td> as in <i>b<u>a</u>th</i> (not as in <i>face</i>)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b><center><font color="#FF1493">e</font></center></b>
</td>
<td> as in <i>g<u>e</u>t</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b><center><font color="#FF1493">i</font></center></b>
</td>
<td> as in <i>mach<u>i</u>ne</i> (not as in <i>hit</i>)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b><center><font color="#FF1493">o</font></center></b>
</td>
<td> as in <i>ch<u>o</u>ice</i>, <i>n<u>o</u>t</i> or <i>ough</i> in <i>th<u>ough</u>t</i> (not as in <i>so</i>, <b>o</b> should be a "pure" sound).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b><center><font color="#FF1493">u</font></center></b>
</td>
<td> as in <i>c<u>oo</u>l</i> (not as in <i>but</i>)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b><center><font color="#FF1493">y</font></center></b>
</td>
<td> as in <i>comm<u>a</u></i> (not as in <i>misty</i> or <i>cycle</i>)
</td></tr></tbody></table>

As for consonants they are pronounced like in English or Latin, but there are a few differences:

<table class="wikitable">
<tbody><tr>
<td><b>c</b>
</td>
<td>is pronounced as <i>c</i> in <i>ocean</i>, as <i>sh</i> in <i>shop</i>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>g</b>
</td>
<td>always <i>g</i> as in <i>gum</i> (never <i>g</i> as in <i>gem</i>).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>j</b>
</td>
<td>like <i>s</i> in <i>pleasure</i> or <i>treasure</i>, like <i>j</i> in French <i>bonjour</i>.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>x</b>
</td>
<td>like <i>ch</i> in Scottish <i>loch</i> or as in German <i>Bach</i>, Spanish <i>Jose</i> or Arabic <i>Khaled</i>. Try pronouncing <i>ksss</i> while keeping your tongue down and you get this sound.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b> ' </b>
</td>
<td>like English <i>h</i>. So the apostrophe is regarded as a proper letter of Lojban and pronounced like a <i>h</i>. It can be found only between vowels. For example, <b>u'i</b> is pronounced as <i>oo-hee</i> (whereas <b>ui</b> is pronounced as <i>wee</i>).
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>.</b>
</td>
<td>a full stop (period, word break) is also regarded as a letter in Lojban. It's a short pause in speech to stop words running into each other. Actually any word starting with a vowel has a full stop placed in front of it. This helps prevent undesirable merging of two sequential words into one.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>i</b>&nbsp;before&nbsp;vowels:<br/><b>ia</b>,&nbsp;<b>ie</b>...
</td>
<td>is considered a consonant and pronounced shorter, for example:
<ul><li><b>ia</b> is pronounced as <i>ya</i> in <i>yard</i></li>
<li><b>ie</b> is pronounced as <i>ye</i> in <i>yes</i></li></ul>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>u</b>&nbsp;before&nbsp;vowels:<br/><b>ua</b>,&nbsp;<b>ue</b>...
</td>
<td>is considered a consonant and pronounced shorter, for example:
<ul><li><b>ua</b> is pronounced as <i>wo</i> in <i>wow</i></li>
<li><b>ue</b> is pronounced as <i>whe</i> in <i>when</i></li></ul>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Stress is put on the last but one vowel or shown explicitly using symbol **\`** before the stressed vowel in order to break this rule. For example, **dansu** (which means _to dance_) can be also written as **d\`ansu** to explicitly show the stress. If a word has only one vowel you just don't stress it.

**r** can be pronounced like the _r_ in English, Scottish, French, Russian, thus there is a range of acceptable pronunciation for it.

Non-Lojban vowels like short _i_ and _u_ in Standard British English _hit_ and _but_ are used by some people to separate consonants. So if you have problems spitting out two consonant one after another, e.g. the **vl** in **tavla** (which means _to talk to_), then you can say _tavɪla_ — where the _ɪ_ is very short, but other vowels: **a**, **u** have to be long.

### The simplest sentence

  </figcaption>
</figure>


Now let's turn to constructing our first sentences in Lojban.

>**le prenu cu tavla mi**  
>_The person speaks to me._

One of your first thoughts might be "Where are nouns and verbs in Lojban?"

Well, in Lojban we mostly speak of relations rather than nouns and verbs.

Here are the two relation words, which roughly correspond to verbs:

**prenu** means _... is a person / are people_.

**tavla** means _... speaks to ..._.

To turn such a "verb" into a noun phrase we put a short word **le** in front of it: 

**le prenu** means _the person_.

Similarly, since **tavla** means _... speaks to ..._ then 

**le tavla** means _the speaker_.

It might sound strange how person can be a "verb" but in fact this makes Lojban very simple:

<table class="wikitable">
<tbody><tr>
<th> relation </th>
<th> noun phrase
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>prenu</b> - <i>to be a person</i> </td>
<td> <b>le prenu</b> - <i>the person</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>tavla</b> - <i>to speak to</i> </td>
<td> <b>le tavla</b> - <i>the speaker</i>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

We can also say that **le** creates a noun phrase from a relation word with roughly the meaning of _one which is …_ (_is a person_ - _the person_), or even _those who do…_ (_to speak to_ - _the speakers_), _those who are…_ (_are people_ - _the people_).

Notice, that Lojban by default doesn't differentiate between _the speaker_ or _the speakers_. That is, **le tavla** is vague in that regard and we will soon discover ways to define the number. 

Finally, we have the little word **mi**, which means _I_ or _me_. It works as a noun phrase by itself (in fact, in English we call such words "pro-nouns"), and **le** is not used for it to make a noun phrase. 

Finally, the little word **cu** (remember that the letter **c** in Lojban is pronounced as _sh_ in English? **cu** is pronounced just as English _shoe_).

The basic sentence in Lojban (we call it **bridi**) has the following parts from the left to the right:

- the head of the sentence: one or more noun phrases or pronouns. The noun phrase **le prenu** in this case.
- the head separator **cu**
- the tail of the sentence: the main relation (**tavla**) with possibly one or more noun phrases or pronouns after it: the pronoun **mi** in this case.

Some more examples:

>**mi prami do**  
>_I love you._

Here, **prami** means _... loves someone or something ..._ and **do** is a pronoun meaning _you_ 

After pronouns **cu** is often omitted, thus **mi cu prami do** is rarely said, a concise **mi prami do** is said instead.

>**mi tavla**  
>_I speak._

>**mi nintadni**  
>_I am a new student._

nintadni
: is a new student, a newbie

Unlike in English we don't have to add the verb "am/is/are/to be" to the sentence. It is already there. The relation word **nintadni** (_... is a new student_) already has this English "am/is/are/to be" built into its English translation.

>**do jimpe**  
>_You understand._

>**mi citka le plise**  
>_I eat the apples._

citka
: to eat (something)

>**mi pilno le fonxa**  
>_I use the phone._

pilno
: to use (something)

fonxa
: is a phone, are phones

le fonxa
: the phone, the phones

>**mi citka**
>_I eat._

>**do citka**
>_You eat._

>**mi citka le plise**  
>_I eath the apples._

>**le plise cu kukte**  
>_The apples are tasty._

Here, **le plise** means _the apples_, **kukte** means _is tasty / are tasty_.

<figure>
  <img src="https://mw.lojban.org/images/thumb/7/77/xractu-mi-cropped.png/96px-xractu-mi-cropped.png" alt="mi">
  <figcaption>

  <figcaption>
  <b>do</b><br/>
  <i>you</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

A simpler sentence in Lojban would contain only one main verb:

>**karce**  
>_Car!_

You could say this when you see a car coming. Here the context would be clear enough that there is a car somewhere around and probably it's dangerous.

**karce** itself is a verb meaning _is a car, to be a car_.

We can of course be more precise and say, for example:

<figure>
  <img src="https://mw.lojban.org/images/thumb/5/5a/xractu-ti-cropped.png/96px-xractu-ti-cropped.png" alt="ti">
  <figcaption>
  <b>ti</b><br/>
  <i>this one (near me, the speaker)</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

>**ti karce**  
>_This is a car._

where **ti** is a pronoun meaning _this thing near me_.

Similarly, you can say

>**carvi**  
>_It is raining._

where

carvi
: _is rain, to be raining_

or

>**pluka**  
>_It's pleasant_

where

pluka
: _to be pleasant_

Notice that in Lojban there is no need in the word _it_ in such sense. You just use the relation word you need.

>**prami**  
>_Someone loves._

>**bajra**  
>_Someone runs._

where **bajra** - _to run using limbs_.

Again context would probably tell who loves whom and who runs.

Some more examples:

##### Task

<table class="wikitable" width="100%">

<tbody><tr>
<td style="width: 50%;"><b>do citka</b>
</td>
<td style="width: 50%;"><i>You eat.</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>mi pinxe lo ladru</b>
</td>
<td><i>I drink milk.</i>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>mi citka lo plise</b>
</td>
<td><i>I eat apples.</i>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

### **.i** separates sentences

The most precise way of uttering or writing sentences in Lojban would be placing a short word **.i** in the beginning of each of them:

>**.i mi viska lo mlatu .i lo mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_I see cats. Cats drink milk._

viska
: to see (something)

**.i** separates sentences like the full stop (period) at the end of sentences in English texts.

When saying one sentence after another in English we make a pause (it may be short) between them. But pause has many different meanings in English. In Lojban we have a better way of understanding where one sentence ends and another begins.

Also note that sometimes when pronouncing words quickly you can't figure out where one sentence ends and the word of the next sentence begins. Therefore it's advised to use the word **.i** before starting a new sentence.

### Numbers: _1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0_ = **pa re ci vo mu xa ze bi so no**

**lo** simply turns a verb into a noun but such noun has no number associated with it. The sentence

>**lo mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats drink milk._

is a general statement. Now let's specify how many of them are relevant to our discussion.

Let's add a number after **lo**.

<table class="wikitable">
<tbody><tr>
<td> <b>pa</b>
</td>
<td> <b>re</b>
</td>
<td> <b>ci</b>
</td>
<td> <b>vo</b>
</td>
<td> <b>mu</b>
</td>
<td> <b>xa</b>
</td>
<td> <b>ze</b>
</td>
<td> <b>bi</b>
</td>
<td> <b>so</b>
</td>
<td> <b>no</b>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 1
</td>
<td> 2
</td>
<td> 3
</td>
<td> 4
</td>
<td> 5
</td>
<td> 6
</td>
<td> 7
</td>
<td> 8
</td>
<td> 9
</td>
<td> 0
</td></tr></tbody></table>

**ro** = _each, all_.

Now

>**pa mlatu cu citka lo plise**  
>_One cat eats apples. There is one cat that eats apples._

We replace **lo** with a number and hence specify individual cats.

Note that we retain **lo** for apples since we talk not about specific apples but about eating any apples.

For numbers consisting of several digits we just string those digits together.

>**re mu mlatu cu citka lo plise**  
>_There are 25 cats who eat apples._

Yes, it's that simple.

If we want to count we can separate numbers with **.i**:

>**mu .i vo .i ci .i re .i pa .i no**  
>_5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... 0_

**ro** is used to express the meaning of _each, every, all_:

>**ro mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Every cat drinks milk._

The number **za'u** means _more than ..._ (_\>_ in math), the number **me'i** means _less than_ (_<_ in math):

>**za'u mlatu cu pinxe**  
>_More of the cats drink._

>**me'i mlatu cu pinxe**  
>_Fewer of the cats drink._

>**za'u ci mlatu cu pinxe**  
>_More than three cats are drinking._

>**me'i ci mlatu cu pinxe**  
>_Fewer than three cats are drinking._

To say just _cats_ (plural number) as opposed to _one cat_ we use **za'u pa**, _more than one_.

>**za'u pa mlatu cu pinxe**  
>_There are cats that drink._

>**pa mlatu cu pinxe**  
>_One cat drinks. There is one cat that is drinking._

Putting **za'u** before **lo** means _more_, putting **me'i** means _fewer_:

To put it in short:

lo prenu
: people (in general)

pa prenu
: there is one person

za'u prenu
: more of the people

za'u pa prenu
: people (two or more in number)

>**me'i pa re plise cu kukte**

>_Each of the people eats. Fewer people eat oranges._  
>**ro prenu cu citka .i me'i prenu cu citka lo najnimre**

### _the_, _he_ and _she_

>**pa mlatu cu pinxe i le mlatu cu taske**  
>_There is a cat that is drinking. The cat is thirsty._

taske
: to be thirsty

When we start a noun with **le** (instead of **lo** or numbers) we refer to nouns that have just been mentioned. They are translated to English as _he_, _she_ or by using the article _the_.

lo fetsi
: females

lo nakni
: males

lo prenu
: people

le fetsi
: she, the female

le nakni
: he, the male

le prenu
: he or she, the person (gender is not known or not important)

If several nouns can match then the last one is used:

>**pa prenu cu viska pa fetsi i le fetsi cu melbi**  
>_One person sees a female. She (the female) is beautiful._

melbi
: to be beautiful

In this case **le fetsi** is applied to the female as it is the last female object mentioned. The person who sees her might be female too but it's a noun used earlier.

In spoken language **le** can be applied to nouns not found in text but obvious from context. Consider the outer reality a part of the text.

### Compound verbs

Compound verbs (**lo tanru** in Lojban) are several verb words one after another.

>**tu melbi zdani**  
>_That one is a nice home._

melbi
: to be beautiful, nice

zdani
: to be a home or nest (to someone)

>**do melbi dansu**  
>_You nicely dance._

dansu
: to dance

Here the verb **melbi** adds an additional meaning as it is to the left of another verb: **zdani**. The left part is usually translated using adjectives and adverbs.

Compound verbs are a powerful tool that can give us richer verbs. You just string two verbs together. And the left part of such compound verb adds a flavor to the right one.

We can put **lo** or a number to the left of such compound verb getting a compound noun:

pa melbi zdani
: a beautiful home.

Now you know why there was **cu** after nouns in our example

>**pa mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_A cat drinks milk._

Without **cu** it'd turn into **pa mlatu pinxe** … with the meaning _a cat drinker_ whatever that could mean.

Remember about placing **cu** before the main verb in a clause to prevent unintentional creating of compound verbs.

Compound verbs can contain more than two verbs. In this case the first verb modifies the second one, the second one modifies the third and so on:

pa melbi cmalu verba
: a pretty-small child, a child small in a pretty way

verba
: to be a child

pa mutce melbi zdani
: a very beautiful home

mutce
: to be very, to be much

### "_Yes/No_" questions

In English, we make a _yes/no_ question by changing the order of the words (for example, "_You are …_" — "_Are you …?_") or putting some form of the verb _to do_ at the beginning (for example, _Do you know?_) In Lojban we can retain the order of words.

We turn any assertion into a _yes/no_ question by simply putting the word **xu** somewhere in the sentence, for example in the beginning:

>**xu do nelci lo gerku?**  
>_Do you like dogs?_

lo gerku
: dog, dogs

Remember that in Lojban punctuation like "?" (question mark) is totally optional and used mostly for stylistic purposes. After all, we use the question word **xu** that shows the question anyway.

Other examples:

>**xu mi klama**  
>_Am I coming?_

klama
: to come (to somewhere)

>**xu pelxu**  
>_Is it yellow?_

pelxu
: to be yellow

We can shift the meaning by placing **xu** after different parts of a clause. Some possible explanations of such shift in meaning are given in brackets:

>**— xu do nelci lo gerku**  
>_— Do you like dogs?_

>**— do xu nelci lo gerku**  
>_— Do YOU like dogs? (I thought it was someone else who likes them)._

>**— do nelci xu lo gerku**  
>_— Do you LIKE dogs? (I thought you were just neutral towards them)._

>**— do nelci lo gerku xu**  
>_— Do you like DOGS? (I thought you liked cats)._

So what is expressed using intonation in English is expressed by moving **xu** after the part we want to emphasize. Note, that the first sentence with **xu** in the beginning asks the most generic question without stressing any particular aspect.

**xu** is an interjection word. Here are the features of Lojban interjections:

- interjection modifies the construct before it. So when put after certain part of the clause like pronoun or a verb it modifies that verb:
 >**do xu nelci lo gerku**  
 >_Do YOU like dogs?_  
- being put in the beginning of a clause, interjection modifies the whole clause: **xu do nelci lo gerku** - _Do you like dogs?_
- we can put an interjection after different parts of the same clause shifting the meaning.

Interjections don't break compound verbs, they can be used within them:

>**— do nelci lo barda xu gerku**  
>_— Do you like BIG dogs?_

Now how to reply to such 'yes/no' questions?

>**— xu do nelci lo gerku**  
>_— Do you like dogs?_

>**— je'u**  
>_— Yes._  
>`— True`

or

>**je'u nai**  
>_No._  
>`Not true`

Another way to answer _yes_ is to repeat the main verb, for example

>— **xu lo mlatu cu melbi**  
>— **melbi**  
>— _Are cats pretty?_  
>— _Pretty._  

**je'u** and **je'u nai** are also interjections. We can use them not only in questions:

>**je'u do lazni**   
>_Truly you are lazy._

lazni
: to be lazy

>**je'u nai mi nelci lo gerku**  
>_It is false that I like dogs._

The particle **nai** is a modifier of interjections, it creates the opposite meaning when put after them.

### Polite requests

The interjection **.e'o** in the beginning of a sentence turns it into a request:

>**.e'o do lebna le cukta**  
>_Could you take the book, please?_  
>`Please take the book.`

.e'o
: interjection: please (pronounced as_ eh-haw _with a short pause or break before the word)

lebna
: to take (something)

le cukta
: the book

In English to be polite one has to use _could you_ + _please_ + a question). In Lojban **.e'o** is enough to make a polite request.

### "_And_" and "_or_"

>**pa melbi je cmalu zdani cu zvati ti**  
>_A pretty and small home is here._

zvati
: to be present at ...

ti
: this thing, this place near me

**je** is a conjunction particle in Lojban, it means _and_ in compound verbs.

Without **je** the sentence changes the meaning:

>**pa melbi cmalu zdani cu zvati**  
>_A prettily small home is here._

Here **melbi** modifies **cmalu** and **melbi cmalu** modifies **zdani** according to how compound verbs work.

In **pa melbi je cmalu zdani** (_a pretty and small house_) both **melbi** and **cmalu** modify **zdani** directly.

For connecting nouns and pronouns we use a similar conjunction **.e**:

>**mi .e do nelci lo jisra**  
>_I like juice, and you like juice._

lo jisra
: juice

Using conjunctions it's possible to connect sentences as well:

>**mi nelci lo plise .i je do nelci lo jisra**  
>_I like apples. And you like juice._

Other common conjunction particles:

>**le verba cu fengu ja bilma**  
>_The child is angry or ill (or maybe both angry and ill)_

>**do .a mi ba vitke le laldo**  
>_You or I (or both of us) will visit the old one._

ja
: and/or

**.a** = _and/or_ when connecting nouns and pronouns.

fengu
: to be angry

bilma
: to be ill

vitke
: to visit

laldo
: to be old

>**le karce cu blabi jo nai grusi**  
>_The car is either white or gray._

>**do .o nai mi vitke le laldo**  
>_Either you or I visit the old one._

jo nai
: _either … or … but not both_ <span style="font-style: normal;">(it consists of two words but it has one single meaning)</span>

.o nai
: _either … or … but not both_ <span style="font-style: normal;">when connecting nouns and pronouns</span>

Note that it's better to remember **jo nai** as a single construct. The same for **.o nai**.

>**mi prami do .i ju do fenki**  
>_I love you. Whether or not you are crazy._

>**le verba cu nelci lo plise .u lo badna**  
>_The child likes apples whether or not (he likes) bananas._

ju
: whether or not…

.u
: _whether or not…_ <span style="font-style: normal;">when connecting nouns and pronouns</span>.

fenki
: to be crazy

### **jo'u** is _and_ for joint actions

When we need to show that nouns are considered together, instead of **.e** we use the particle **jo'u**:

>**pa nanla jo'u pa nixli cu klama pa panka**  
>_A boy with a girl go to a park._

pa nanla
: a boy

pa nixli
: a girl

pa panka
: a park

Another example:

>**pa nanla jo'u pa nixli cu casnu pa karce**  
>_A boy and a girl discuss a car with each other._

casnu
: to discuss

The verb **casnu** requires using **jo'u** to specify a group of those who discuss between each other. Compare:

>**pa nanla .e pa nixli cu klama pa panka**  
>_A boy goes to a park, and a girl goes to a park._

This means that they don't necessarily go together.

Again notice that omitting **lo** or numbers starting nouns can cause weird results:

>**pa nanla jo'u nixli cu casnu pa karce**  
>_Someone who is a boy and a girl (at the same time considered together!) discusses a car._

The correct sentence uses **lo** or a number before each noun:

>**lo nanla jo'u lo nixli cu casnu pa karce**  
>_Boys and girls discuss a car._

>**pa nanla jo'u pa nixli cu casnu pa karce**  
>_A boy and a girl discuss a car._

The pronoun **mi'o** (_you and I together_) can actually be expressed as **mi jo'u do**, which means exactly the same (it's just longer). In Lojban people mostly use not a single word for _we_ but more precise constructs like **mi jo'u lo pendo** (literally _I and friends_).

</td></tr></tbody></table>

### But …

>**lo najnimre cu barda i ku'i je lo badna cu cmalu**  
>_Oranges are big. But bananas are small._

ku'i
: interjection: but, however

Actually _but_ is the same as _and_ + it adds a flavor of contrast.

In Lojban we just use the interjection **ku'i** and then add **je** (_and_). That will give us the necessary contrast.

### Events: _dancing and being together_ - **lo nu dansu .e lo nu kansa**

Any clause can be turned into a verb by putting **nu** in front of it:

>**lo nicte cu nu mi viska le lunra**  
>_Night is when I see the Moon._  
>`Night is the event when I see the Moon.`

nicte
: (some event) is a nighttime

lo nicte
: night (in general sense), nighttimes

viska
: to see (something)

le lunra
: the Moon

Here **lo nicte** is a noun of the clause and **nu mi viska le lunra** is the main verb of the clause as it starts with **nu**. But inside this main verb we can see another clause (**mi viska le lunra**) embedded!

The word **nu** actually transforms a clause into a verb that denotes an event or a process.

Adding **lo** in front of **nu** creates nouns that denote events:

pinxe
: to drink

lo nu pinxe
: drinking

dansu
: to dance

lo nu dansu
: dancing

kansa
: to be together with

lo nu kansa
: being together

klama
: to come

lo nu klama
: coming

lo nu do klama
: coming of you, you coming

**lo nu** often corresponds to English _\-ing_, _\-tion_, _\-sion_.

Some verbs require using events instead of ordinary nouns. For example:

>**mi djica lo nu do klama ti**  
>_I want you to come here (to this place)_

djica
: to want (some event)

Some nouns describe events by themselves so no **lo nu** is used:

>**lo cabna cu nicte**  
>_Now it's night. At present it's night._

lo cabna
: present time, (an event) is at present.

Nouns made with **lo nu** can be used for verbs that describe events by themselves:

>**lo nu pinxe lo ladru cu nabmi mi**  
>_Drinking milk is a problem to me._

nabmi
: (event) is a problem (to someone), (event) is problematic (to someone)

For known events we use **le nu** instead:

>**mi gleki le nu do klama**  
>_I'm happy because you are coming._

gleki
: to be happy (of some event)

lo gleki
: a happy one, a happy person

All Lojban words are divided into two groups:

- particles (called **lo cmavo** in Lojban). Examples: **lo**, **nu**, **mi**
- verbs (called **lo selbrivla** in Lojban). Examples: **gleki**, **verba**.  
  It is quite common to write several particles one after another without spaces between them. This is allowed by Lojban grammar. So don't be surprised to see **lonu** instead of **lo nu**, **je'unai** instead of **je'u nai**, **jonai** instead of **jo nai** and so on. This doesn't change the meaning. However, this is not applied to verbs: they are to be separated with spaces.

### Prepositions and tenses: _was_, _is_, _will be_ - **pu**, **ca**, **ba**

Prepositions in Lojban are grouped into series by their meaning to make them easier to remember and use.

Here is the series of "prepositions of tense" that tell when something happens:

>**mi pinxe lo ladru ca lo nu do klama**  
>_I drink milk while you are coming._

>**mi citka ba lo nu mi dansu**  
>_I eat after I dance._

- **pu** means _before (some event)_ or denotes past tense.
- **ca** means _at the same time as (some event)_ or denotes present tense.
- **ba** means _after some event_ or denotes future tense.

Yes, we need **lo nu** to insert a whole clause after such prepositions.

Let's put a bare preposition just before the main verb:

>**lo mlatu pu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats drank milk._

>**lo mlatu ca pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats drink milk (at present)._

>**lo mlatu ba pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats will drink milk._

Here **pu** denotes past tense, **ca** denotes present tense, **ba** denotes future tense.

As you can see we replaced **cu** with a preposition since prepositions also clearly separate the head from the main verb.

Tenses add information about time when something happens. English forces us to use certain tenses. One has to choose between

* _Cats drink milk_.
* _Cats drank milk_.
* _Cats will drink milk_.

and other similar choices.

But in Lojban prepositions of tense like all prepositions are optional, we can be as vague or as precise as we want.

The sentence

>**lo mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats drink milk._

actually says nothing about when this happens. Context is clear enough in most cases and can help us. But if we need more precision we just add more words.

Similarly, **ba** means _after (some event)_ so when we say **mi ba citka** we mean that we eat after the moment of speaking, that's why it means _I will eat_.

We can combine tense words with and without clauses after them:

>**mi pu citka lo plise ba le nu mi dansu**  
>_I ate apples after I danced._

Note, that **pu** (past tense) is put only in the main clause (**mi pu citka**). In Lojban it is assumed that the event "I danced" happens relatively to the event of eating.

We shouldn't put **pu** with **dansu** (unlike English) as **mi dansu** is viewed relative to **mi pu citka** so we already know that everything was in past.

More examples of prepositions of tense:

>**le nicte cu pluka**  
>_The night is pleasant._

pluka
: to be pleasant

Tense words before nouns and pronouns turn into prepositions:

>**ba le nicte cu pluka**  
>_After the night it is pleasant._

Here, the head of the clause is **ba le nicte**, a preposition with its noun. Then after the separator **cu** the main verb of the clause **pluka** is followed (**pluka** alone means _It is pleasant_). Therefore, to say _will be pleasant_ we should place the tense word before the main verb:

>**le nicte ba pluka**  
>_The night will be pleasant._

Note that **ca** can extend slightly into the past and the future, meaning _just about now_. Thus, **ca** reflects a widely used around the world the notion of "present time".

### Prepositions of aspect: **co'a**, **ca'o**, **co'i**

Another series of prepositions, _prepositions of aspect_:

co'a
: preposition: the event is at its beginning

ca'o
: preposition: the event is in progress

co'i
: preposition: the event is viewed as a whole (has started and then finished)

Most verbs describe events without specifying the stage of those events. Prepositions of aspect allow us to be more precise:

>**mi pu co'a cikna**  
>_I woke up._

cikna
: ... is awake

co'a cikna
: ... wakes up, becomes awake

To precisely express English Progressive tense we use **ca'o**:

>**mi pu ca'o pinxe**  
>_I was drinking._

>**mi ca ca'o pinxe**  
>_I am drinking._

>**mi ba ca'o pinxe**  
>_I will be drinking._

**co'i** usually corresponds to English Perfect tense:

>**lo mlatu ca co'i pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats have drunk milk._

We could omit **ca** in these sentence since the context would be clear enough in most such cases.

Present Simple tense in English describes events that happen sometimes:

>**lo mlatu ca ta'e pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats (habitually, sometimes) drink milk._

ta'e
: simple tense: the event happens habitually

We can use the same rules for describing the past using **pu** instead of **ca** or the future using **ba**:

>**lo mlatu pu co'i pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats had drunk milk._

>**lo mlatu ba co'i pinxe lo ladru**  
>_Cats will have drunk milk._

The relative order of tenses is important. In **ca co'i** we first say something happens in present (**ca**), then we state that in this present time the described event has been completed (**co'i**). Only when using this order we get Present Perfect tense.

### Prepositions of interval: _during_ - **ze'a**

Another series of prepositions emphasizes that events happened during an interval:

ze'i
: for a short time

ze'a
: through some time, for a while, during ...

ze'u
: for a long time

>**mi pu ze'a sipna**  
>_I slept for a while._

>**mi pu sipna ze'a pa nicte**  
>_I slept through the night. I slept all night._

>**mi pu sipna ze'i pa nicte**  
>_I slept through the short night._

Compare **ze'a** with **ca**:

>**mi pu sipna ca pa nicte**  
>_I slept at night._

sipna
: to sleep

pa nicte
: a nighttime

When using **ze'a** we are talking about the whole interval of what we describe. ﻿ Don't forget that **nicte** is itself an event so we don't need **nu** here.

### Other useful prepositions: _because_ - **ri'a**, _towards_ - **fa'a**, _at (place)_ - **bu'u**

Preposition for _because_:

>**mi pinxe ri'a lo nu mi taske**  
>_I drink because I am thirsty._

>**mi citka ri'a lo nu mi xagji**  
>_I eat because I am hungry._

ri'a
: because … (of some event)

taske
: to be thirsty

xagji
: to be hungry

Prepositions denoting place work the same way:

>**mi klama fa'a do to'o pa mlatu**  
>_I go to you from a cat._

>**mi cadzu bu'u le tcadu**  
>_I walk in the city._

fa'a
: towards …, in the direction of …

to'o
: from …, from the direction of …

bu'u
: at … (some place)

One thing is important. **nu** shows that a new clause in a sentence starts. Put **vau** after such clause to show its right border. Here is an example:

>**pa mlatu cu plipe fa'a mi ca lo nu do ca'o klama**  
>_A cat jumps towards me when you are coming._

plipe
: to jump

but

>**pa mlatu cu plipe ca lo (nu do ca'o klama vau) fa'a mi**  
>_A cat jumps (when you are coming) towards me._

(brackets are used here only to show the structure)

We use **vau** after the clause **nu do ca'o klama** to show that it ended and other parts of the sentence begin like **cu**, a preposition, a noun or a pronoun. ﻿ Compare this sentence with the following:

>**pa mlatu cu plipe ca lo (nu do ca'o klama fa'a mi)**  
>_A cat jumps (when you are coming towards me)._

As you can see **do klama fa'a mi** is a clause inside the big one. So **fa'a mi** is now inside it.

Now you, not the cat, come towards me.

At the end of the sentence **vau** is never needed as it's already the right border.

One more example with a tense particle:

>**mi pu citka lo plise ba le nu mi dansu**  
>_I ate apples after I danced._

>**mi pu citka ba le nu mi dansu vau lo plise**  
>_I ate (after I danced) apples._

Thus we can move **ba le nu mi dansu** around the sentence provided that it's still put after **pu**.

### Negation

The preposition **na** makes everything to its right within the clause negative in meaning:

>**mi na nelci do**  
>_I don't like you._

na
: preposition: it is not true that ...

Its opposite, the preposition **ja'a** affirms the meaning:

>**mi ja'a nelci do**  
>_I do like you._

ja'a
: preposition: it is true that ...

### Names. Choosing a name

**lo cmevla**, or _name word_ is a special kind of verb used to build personal names. It's easy to recognize lo cmevla in a flow of text as only lo cmevla end in a consonant.

Besides, they are wrapped by one dot from each side.

Examples of lo cmevla are: **.paris.**, **.robin.**

If one's name is Bob then we can create a cmevla ourselves that would sound as close as possible to this name, for example **.bob.**

The most simple example of using a name would be

>**la .bob. cu tcidu**  
>_Bob reads/is reading._

tcidu
: to read

**la** is similar to **lo** but it converts a verb not to a simple noun but to a name.

In English we start a word with a capital letter to show that it's a name. In Lojban we use the prefix word **la**.

Always use **la** when producing names!

A name can consist of several cmevla one after another:

>**la .bob.djonson. cu tcidu**  
>_Bob Johnson reads/is reading._

Here, we separated the two cmevla with just one dot, which is also a common style.

It's common to omit dots in front of and at the end of lo cmevla to write texts faster, for example, when text chatting. After all, lo cmevla are still separated from neighboring words by spaces around them:

**la bob djonson cu tcidu**

However, in spoken language it is still necessary to put a short pause before and after lo cmevla.

Bob's first name goes into Lojban without much changes. The same for the name _Lojban_. It's a cmevla and is written as **.lojban.**:

>**la .lojban. cu bangu mi**  
>_I speak Lojban._
Lojban is a language of me.    
>`Lojban is a language I use.`

bangu
: is a language (used by someone)

However, Lojban letters directly correspond to sounds. Therefore, there are some rules for adapting names to how they are written in Lojban. This may sound strange — after all, a name is a name — but in fact all languages do this to some extent. For example, English speakers tend to pronounce _Jose_ something like _Hozay_, and _Margaret_ in Chinese is *Magelita*. Some sounds just don't exist in some languages, so you need to rewrite the name so that it only contains Lojban sounds, and is spelt according to letter-sound correspondence.

Example:

la .djonson.
: Johnson

la .suzyn.
: Susan

In the English name _Susan_ the two letters _s_ are pronounced differently. The second one is actually a _z_, and the _a_ is not really an _a_ sound, it's the "schwa" explained in the beginning of this chapter. So _Susan_ is written **.suzyn.** in Lojban.

Pay attention to how the name is pronounced natively. Thus, the English and French names _Robert_ come out differently in Lojban: the English name is rather **.robyt.** in UK English, or **.rabyrt.** in some American dialects, but the French is **.rober.**

Here are some names that we'll use throughout this book:

<table class="wikitable">

- Two extra full stops (periods) are necessary because if you didn't put those pauses in speech, you might not know where the name started and ended, or in other words where the previous word ended and the next word began.
- The last letter of a cmevla must be a consonant. And if a name doesn't end in a consonant we usually add use _s_ to the end; so in Lojban, _Mary_ becomes **.meris.**, _Joe_ becomes **.djos.** and so on. An alternative is to leave out the last vowel, so _Mary_ would become **.mer.** or **.meir.**
- You can also put a full stop in between a person's first and last names (though it's not compulsory), so _Jim Jones_ becomes **.djim.djonz.**

#### Rules for making lo cmevla

Here is a compact representation of Lojban sounds:

- vowels:
  - **a e i o u y au ai ei oi**
- consonants
  - **b d g v z j** (voiced)
  - **p t k f s c x** (unvoiced)
  - **l m n r**
  - **i u**. They are considered consonants when put between two vowels or in the beginning of a word. **.iaua** - **i** and **u** are consonants here. **.iai** - here is the consonant **i** with an vowel **ai** after it.
  - **'** (apostrophe). It is put only between two vowels: **.e'e**, **.u'i**
  - **.** (dot, word break)

We first write a name with Lojban letters and then change it according to these rules:

1.  it ends in consonants except **'** . Additionally they are wrapped by a dot from each side: **.lojban.** It's quite common to omit word breaks in informal texts.
2.  vowels can be put only between two consonants: **.sam.**, **.no'am.**
3.  double consonants are merged into one: _dd_ becomes **d**, _nn_ becomes **n** etc. Or a **y** is out between them: **.nyn.**
4.  if a voiced and a unvoiced consonants are next to each other then **y** is inserted inside: **kv** becomes **kyv**. Or you can remove one of the letters instead: **pb** can be turned into a single **p** or a single **b**.
5.  if one of **c**, **j**, **s**, **z** are next to each other then **y** is inserted inside: **jz** becomes **jyz**. Or you can remove one of the letters instead: **cs** can be turned into a single **c** or a single **s**.
6.  if **x** is next to **c** or next to **k** then **y** is inserted inside: **cx** becomes **cyx**, **xk** becomes **xyk**. Or you can remove one of the letters instead: **kx** can be turned into a single **x**.
7.  the substrings **mz**, **nts**, **ntc**, **ndz**, **ndj** are fixed by adding **y** inside or deleting one of the letters: **nytc** or **nc**, **.djeimyz.**
8.  double **ii** between vowels is merged into a single **i**: **.eian.** (but not **.eiian.**)
9.  double **uu** between vowels is merged into a single **u**: **.auan.** (but not **.auuan.**)

#### Other verbs as names

You can use not only cmevla, but also other types of verbs to choose your nickname in Lojban. If you prefer, you can translate your name into Lojban (if you know what it means, of course) or adopt a completely new Lojban identity.

Here are a few examples of Lojbanic names:

#### **le** and names

<side>
Lojban has a single term **lo sumti** = _"noun or pronoun or name"_ Indeed, nouns, pronouns and names work grammatically exactly the same in Lojban. For brevity we'll be calling them all _nouns_.
</side>
**le** can be used to refer to names mentioned earlier:

>**la alis cu klama pa zarci i le fetsi cu xagji**  
>_Alice is going to a shop. She is hungry._

xagji
: to be hungry

>**la alis cu viska la doris i le fetsi cu melbi**  
>_Alice can see Doris. She (Doris) is beautiful._

Here, **le fetsi** is applied to Doris, the last noun describing a female person.

In this example we assume that both Alice and Doris are females.

_Vocatives_ in Lojban are words that function just like interjections (**xu** which we earlier discussed) but they attach the following noun after them:

>**coi do**  
>_Hello, you!_

coi
: vocative: Hello! Hi!

We use **coi** + a noun or pronoun to greet someone.

>**co'o do**  
>_Goodbye to you._

co'o
: vocative: goodbye!

<div class="common">
<b>coi ro do</b><br/><i>Hello each of you</i> <br/>is how people usually start a conversation with several people. <b>coi re do</b> means <i>Hello you two</i> and can be useful when, for example, one starts a letter to their parents).
</div>

Since vocatives work like interjections we have nice types of greetings:

<div class="common">
<b>cerni coi</b><br/>
<i>Good morning!</i>
<pre>It's morning — Hello!</pre>

<b>vanci coi</b><br/>
<i>Good evening!</i>

<b>donri coi</b><br/>
<i>Good day!</i>
</div>

>**nicte coi**  
>_Nightly greetings!_

Note that in English "Goodnight!" means "Goodbye!" or denotes wishing someone spending good night. By its meaning "Goodnight!" doesn't belong to the series of greetings above. Thus, we use a different wording in Lojban:

<div class="common">
<b>nicte co'o</b><br/>
<i>Goodnight!</i><br/>
<b>a'o pluka nicte</b><br/>
<i>Pleasant night!</i>
</div>

a'o
: interjection: I hope

pluka
: to be pleasant to … (someone)

Of course, we can be vague by just saying **pluka nicte** (just meaning _pleasant night_ without any wishes explicitly said).

The vocative **mi'e** + a noun/pronoun is used to introduce yourself:

>**mi'e la .doris.**  
>_I'm Doris. This is Doris speaking._

mi'e
: vocative: identifies speaker

The vocative **doi** is used to show who we're talking to:

>**mi cliva doi la .robert.**  
>_I'm leaving, Robert._

cliva
: to leave (something or someone)

Without **doi** the name might become the first noun of the clause:

>**mi cliva la .robert.**  
>_I'm leaving Robert._

**doi** is a like Old English _O_ (as in _O ye of little faith_) or the Latin vocative (as in _Et tu, Brute_). Some languages don't distinguish between these contexts although as you can see Old English and Latin did.

Two more vocatives are are **ki'e** for saying thanks and **je'e** for accepting them:

**— ki'e do do pu sidju mi  
— je'e do**  
_— Thank you, you helped me.  
— Not at all._

sidju
: to help (someone)

We can omit the noun after the vocative only if this is the ends of the sentence. For example we can just say

>**— coi .i xu do kanro**  
>_— Hello. How do you do?_  
>`— Hello. Are you healthy?`

kanro
: to be healthy

Here, a new sentence starts immediately after the vocative **coi** so we omitted the name. Or we can say:

>**coi do mi djica lo nu do sidju mi**  
>_Hello. I want you to help me._  
>`Hello you. I want that you help me.`

Thus, in case you don't know the name of the listener you just place **do** after it if you want to continue the same sentence after the vocative.

If you use the vocative on its own (without a noun after it) and the sentence is not finished yet then you need to separate it from the rest, because the things likeliest to follow the vocative in a sentence could easily be misconstrued as describing your addressee. Use the word **do** for that. For example,

>**coi do la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**  
>_Hello! Alice left Doris._  
>`Hello you! Alice left Doris`

>**coi la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**  
>_Hello, Alice! Doris left._

And if you want to put both vocatives and interjections modifying the whole sentence please put interjections first:

>**.ui coi do la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**  
>_Yay, Hello! Alice left Doris._

Note that in the beginning of sentences usually interjections are put before vocatives because

**coi .ui do la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**

means

_Hello (I'm happy about this greeting) you! Alice left Doris._

So an interjection immediately after a vocative modifies that vocative. Similarly, interjection modifies the vocative noun when being put after it:

>**coi do .ui la .alis. la .doris. pu cliva**  
>_Hello you (I'm happy about you)! Alice left Doris._

## Lesson 2. More basic stuff

### Order of arguments

Earlier we provided such definitions of verbs as:

mlatu
: is a cat, to be a cat

citka
: to eat

prami
: to love

klama
: to come

The dictionary in the end of this textbook presents all verbs with x1, x2 etc. symbols:

mlatu
: x1 is a cat ...

citka
: x1 eats x2 ...

prami
: x1 loves x2

klama
: x1 comes to x2 ...

These x1, x2 are quite simple. They are called places of arguments and more precisely represent the order in which we add nouns or pronouns. For example:

>**mi prami do**  
>_I love you._

This also means that

- x1 denotes _the one who loves_ and
- x2 denotes _the one who is loved by_.

The advantage of such style of definitions is that all participants of a relation are in one definition.

We can also omit nouns making the sentence more vague:

>**carvi**  
>_It is raining._  
>`is rain, is raining`

(although tense here is determined by context, it can also mean _It often rains_, _It was raining_ etc.)

>**prami do**  
>_Someone loves you._  
>`loves you`

All omitted places in a clause just mean **zo'e** = _something/someone_ so it means the same as

>**zo'e prami do**  
>_Someone loves you._

And

> **prami**  

is the same as

>**zo'e prami zo'e**  
>_Someone loves someone._

Prepositions add new places to verbs but they don't remove existing places. In

>**mi klama fa'a do**  
>_I come towards you._

the second place of **klama** is still omitted. For example:

>**mi klama fa'a pa cmana do**  
>_I come (towards a mountain) to you._

And here the second place of **klama** is **do**. And the sentence means that the mountain is just a direction whereas the final point is you.

Similarly, in

>**mi citka ba lo nu mi cadzu**  
>_I eat after I walk._

the second place of **citka** is still omitted. A new preposition **ba** with its phrase **lo nu mi cadzu** adds meaning to the sentence.

The order of arguments of compound verbs is the same as the of the last verb word in it:

>**tu sutra bajra pendo mi**  
>_That is my quickly running friend._  
>`That is a quickly running friend of me.`

pendo
: to be a friend, is a friend (of someone)

So the order of arguments is the same as of **pendo** alone.

### More than two places

There might be more than two places. For example:

>**mi pinxe lo ladru pa kabri**  
>_I drink milk from a cup._

pinxe
: x1 drinks x2 from x3

>**pa kabri**  
>_a cup_

In this case there are three places and if you want to exclude the second place in the middle you have to use **zo'e:**

>**mi pinxe zo'e pa kabri**  
>_I drink \[something\] from a cup._

If we omit **zo'e** we get something meaningless:

>**mi pinxe pa kabri**  
>_I drink a cup._

Another example:

>**mi dunda pa cukta do**  
>_I give a book to you._

dunda
: x1 gives, donates x2 to x3

pa cukta
: a book

### General rules in the order of arguments

The order of places in verbs might be sometimes hard to remember. But let's not worry — like in English you don't need to remember all places of all verbs (do you remember the meaning of hundreds of thousands of words in English?)

You may study places when you find them useful or when people use them in a dialogue with you.

Most of verbs have one or two places. Usually you can guess the order using context and a few rules of thumb:

1.  The first place is often the person or thing who does something or is something:

    **klama** = _x1 goes ..._

2.  The object of some action is usually just after the first place:

    **punji** = _x1 puts x2 on x3_,

    **dunda** = _x1 gives x2 (gift) to x3 (recipient)_

3.  And the next place will usually be filled with the recipient:

    **punji** = _x1 puts x2 on x3_,

    **dunda** = _x1 gives x2 (gift) to x3 (recipient)_

4.  Destination (_to_) places nearly always come before origins (_from_) places:

    **klama** = _x1 goes to x2 from x3_

5.  Less-used places come towards the end. These tend to be things like ‘by standard’, ‘by means’ or ‘made of’.

The general idea is that first come the places which are most likely to be used.

No need to fill all places all the time. Unfilled places just have values irrelevant or obvious to the speaker (they take the value of **zo'e** = _something_).

### Prepositions and places

Prepositions don't replace places:

>**mi klama fa'a le cmana le zdani be mi**  
>_I go in the direction of the mountain to my home._

le zdani be mi
: home of me, my home

Here, the preposition **fa'a** (_in the direction of_) doesn't replace the second place of the verb **klama** (which is filled with **le zdani be mi** - _my home_). The sentence means that my home is simply located in the direction of the mountain but it doesn't mean I want to reach that mountain.

### Places for nouns

  <figcaption>
  <b>mi dunda pa cukta</b><br/>
  <i>I give a book</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

How do we say *You are my friend* ?

>**do pendo mi**  
>_You are my friend._  
>`You are a friend of me.`

And now how do we say _My friend is crazy._?

>**pa pendo be mi cu fenki**  
>_My friend is crazy._

So when we convert a verb into a noun (**pendo** — _to be a friend_ into **pa pendo** — _a friend_) we can still retain other places of that verb by placing **be** after it.

By default it attaches the second place (x2). We can attach more places by separating them with **bei**:

>**mi dunda le cukta do**  
>_I give the book to you._

>**le dunda be le cukta bei mi**  
>_The grantor of a book to me_

>**le dunda be le cukta bei mi cu pendo mi**  
>_The giver of the book to me is my friend._  
>`The one who gives the book to me is a friend of mine.`

Another example:

>**mi klama pa pendo be do**  
>_I come to a friend of yours._

We can't omit **be** because **pa pendo do** are two independent places:

>**mi klama pa pendo do**  
>_I come to a friend from you._

klama
: x1 comes to x2 from x3 ...

Here, **do** took the third place of **klama** since it's not bound to _pendo **using**_ **be**.

Neither could we use **nu** because **pa nu pendo do** is one event about a friend of yours. So **pa pendo be do** is the correct solution.

Another example:

>**la .lojban. cu bangu mi**  
>_Lojban is my language._  
>`Lojban is a language of me.`

However,

>**mi nelci lo bangu be mi**  
>_I like my language._

Using **be** for verbs not converted to nouns has no effect: **mi nelci be do** is the same as **mi nelci do**.

### Relative clauses

>**pa mlatu poi blabi cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_A cat that is white is drinking milk._

>**pa mlatu noi blabi cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_A cat, which is white, is drinking milk._

blabi
: to be white

In the first sentence the word "_that_" is essential to identifying the cat in question, it clarifies which cat we are talking about. Out of probably many cats we choose only those who are white. Maybe there is only one cat around that is white like in this example.

As for "_which is white_" from the second sentence it just provides additional information about the cat. It doesn't help us to identify cats. For example, this might happen when all the cats are white.

**poi blabi** is a relative clause, a mini-clause attached to the right of the noun **lo mlatu**. It ends just before the next word **cu**:

>**pa mlatu (poi blabi) cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_A cat (that is white) is drinking milk._

So in addition to **pa mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru** — _a cat drinks milk_ we state that the cat is white.

In Lojban we use **poi** for relative clauses that identify entities (objects, people or events) and **noi** for incidental information.

>**le nakni ba co'a speni pa ninmu poi pu xabju lo nurma**  
>_He will marry a girl who lived in the country._

xabju
: to live, to inhabit

lo nurma
: rural area

This sentence doesn't exclude him marrying someone else as well! Removing the relative clause with **poi** changes the meaning:

>**le nakni ba co'a speni pa ninmu**  
>_He will marry a girl._

Another example:

>**lo prenu poi gleki cu ze'u renvi**  
>_People (which ones?) who are happy live long._

ze'u
: preposition: for a long time

renvi
: to survive

Removing the relative clause with **poi** changes the meaning:

>**lo prenu ze'u renvi**  
>_People live long._

On the other hand, relative clauses with **noi** contain just additional information about the noun to which they are attached. That noun is sufficiently defined by itself so that removing a relative clause with **noi** doesn't change its meaning:

> **mi nelci la .doris. noi mi ta'e zgana bu'u pa panka**  
> _I like Doris, whom I habitually see in a park._  
> _I like Doris. What else can I say about her? I habitually see her in a park._  

zgana
: to observe (using any senses)

Removing the relative clause with **noi** retains the meaning: _I like Doris._

In spoken English the distinction is often achieved using intonation or by guessing. Also relative clauses with **noi** are traditionally separated with commas in English, they use _which_ or *who* and the word _that_ is not used in them.

Let's have another example.

>**mi klama pa tricu**  
>_I come to a tree._

>**pa tricu cu barda**  
>_A tree is big._

pa tricu
: a tree

barda
: x1 is big/large

And now let's join those two sentences:

>**pa tricu noi mi klama ke'a cu barda**  
>_A tree, to which I go, is big._

Note the word **ke'a**. We move the second sentence about the same tree into a relative clause and replace the noun **lo tricu** with **ke'a** in the relative clause. So the pronoun **ke'a** is like *who* and _which_ in English. It points back to the noun to which the relative clause is attached.

So literally our Lojbanic sentence sounds like

_A tree, such that I go to which, is big._

**ke'a** can be dropped if we are to place it just after **noi** or **poi**. That's why the two following sentences mean the same:

>**pa mlatu poi blabi cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>**pa mlatu poi ke'a blabi cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_A cat that is white is drinking milk._  

**ke'a** goes to the first unfilled place:

>**le nakni ba co'a speni pa ninmu poi le nakni pu penmi bu'u pa zarci** or  
>**le nakni ba co'a speni pa ninmu poi le nakni pu penmi ke'a bu'u pa zarci**  
> _He will marry a girl whom he had met in a store._  

Here, **le nakni** fills the first place of **penmi**, thus, **ke'a** is assumed for the next, second place.

Relative clauses like usual clauses can contain constructs with prepositions:

>**pa tricu noi mi pu klama ke'a ca lo cabdei cu barda**  
>_A tree, to which I went today, is big._  

lo cabdei
: the day of today

Note that **ca lo cabdei** belongs to the relative clause. Compare:

>**pa tricu noi mi pu klama ke'a cu barda ca lo cabdei**  
>_A tree, to which I went, is big today._  

The meaning has changed a lot.

Finally, **voi** is used to refer to clauses that have just been mentioned:

>**mi zgana pa prenu poi ca'o kelci i mi zgana pa prenu poi ca'o citka i pa prenu voi kelci cu verba**  
>_I observe a person who is playing. I observe a person who is eating. One person (mentioned as playing) is a child._

>**lo cabna cu pluka vanci i lo simsa ditcu voi vanci na cafne**  
>_Now it's a pleasant evening. Such times that is pleasant evenings does not happen often._

lo cabna
: event that is now, in present

simsa
: to be similar

ditcu
: x1 (clause) is a period, some time

cafne
: to happen often

**voi** parallels **le**: **le** refers to nouns in context, **voi** refers to clauses in context. Despite its utility **voi** hasn't been used a lot by Lojban speakers.

### Short relative clauses. "_About_".

Sometimes you might need to attach to a noun an additional noun or pronoun:

>**mi djuno lo vajni pe do**  
>_I know something important about you._

lo vajni
: something important

**pe** and **ne** are similar to **poi** and **noi** but connect nouns (and pronouns) to nouns:

>**pa penbi pe mi cu xunre**  
>_A pen that is mine is red._ (_mine_ is essential to identifying the pen in question)_

>**pa penbi ne mi cu xunre**  
>_A pen, which is mine, is red._ (additional information)_

ne
: which is about, has relation to ... (a noun/pronoun follows)

pe
: that is about, has relation to ... (a noun/pronoun follows)

### **be** and **pe**

Notice that relative clauses are attached to nouns whereas **be** connects to the verb that is transformed into a noun afterwards.

Actually, **lo bangu pe mi** is a better translation of _my language_, since like in English, the two nouns are related to each other in a vague way.

However, you can say **lo birka be mi** as _my arm_. Even if you saw off your arm, it'll still be yours. That's why **birka** has a place of the owner:

birka
: x1 is an arm of x2

Notice that **be** attaches to the verb word. But **pe**, **ne**, **poi** and **noi** attach to nouns. For example,

>**pa melbi be mi cukta pe pa pendo be mi cu barda**  
>_A beautiful to me book of a friend of mine is big._

Here, **be mi** is applied only to the verb **melbi** = _to be beautiful to … (someone)_. But **pe pa pendo** is applied to the whole noun **pa melbi be mi cukta** = _a beautiful to me book_.

It can also happen that we need to attach **be** to a noun and then attach **pe** to the same noun:

>**pa pendo be do be'o pe la paris cu stati**  
>_A friend of yours who is related to Paris is smart._

>**lo pu dunda be pa cukta bei do be'o pe la paris cu stati**  
>_Who gave a book to you (and who is related to Paris) is smart._

**be'o** shows that the nouns attached with **be** and with **bei** (if they are used) end, and thus **pe la paris** is attached to the whole bigger noun **pa pendo be do be'o** and **lo pu dunda be pa cukta bei do be'o**.

Compare it to:

>**pa pendo be do pe la paris cu stati**  
>_A friend of you (who is related to Paris) is smart._

>**lo pu dunda be pa cukta bei do pe la paris cu stati**  
>_Who gave a book to you (who is related to Paris) is smart._

The difference in the meaning is huge. In the first two examples your friend has some relation to Paris (maybe, he/she is from Paris). In the second two examples, you have this relation.

### "_She is a teacher_" and "_She is the teacher_"

In English the verb _is, are, to be_ makes a noun work like a verb in English. In Lojban even such concepts as _cat_ (**mlatu**), _person_ (**prenu**), _house_ (**dinju**), _home_ (**zdani**) work like verbs by default. Only pronouns work as nouns.

However, here are three cases:

>**le nakni cu ctuca**  
>_He teaches._

>**le nakni cu me lo ctuca**  
>_He is one of those who teach._

me
: to be among ..., to be one of ..., to be a member of ... (noun follows)

>**le nakni ta'e ctuca**  
>_He habitually teaches._

ta'e
: preposition: the event happens habitually

>**le nakni cu du le ctuca**  
>_He is the teacher._

du
: to be identical to ...

The particle **me** takes a noun after it and shows that there are probably other teachers, and he is one of them.

However, when using the verb **du** we mean that he is, for example, the teacher that we have been searching for or talking about.

Thus **me** and **du** can sometimes reflect what in English we use the verb _to be/is/was_ for.

In Lojban we first rely on the meaning of what we need to say, not necessarily on how it is literally said in English or other languages.

Other examples:

>**mi me la bond**  
>_I am Bond._

>**mi du la .kevin.**  
>_I am Kevin (the one you needed)._

>**ti du la .alis. noi mi ta'e zgana bu'u pa panka**  
>_This is Alice, whom I often see in a park._

**noi du** and **poi du** are used in Lojban to introduce alternate names for something. So they correspond to English _namely, i.e._:

>**la .alis. cu penmi pa prenu noi du la .abdul.**  
>_Alice met a person, namely Abdul._

### Prepositions inside nouns

We can place a tense not only before the main verb of a clause but at the end of it giving the same result:

**mi ca tcidu  
mi tcidu ca**  
_I (now read)._

tcidu
: to read (some text)

When using **nu** we create a clause. Notice, the difference between these two examples:

>**le nu tcidu ca cu nandu**  
>_The current reading is complicated, difficult._

>**le nu tcidu cu ca nandu**  
>_The reading is now complicated._

Other examples:

>**mi klama pa cmana pu**  
>_I went to a mountain._  
>`I go to a mountain (in past).`

>**lo nu mi klama pa cmana pu cu pluka**  
>_That I went to a mountain is pleasant._

When not using **nu** we don't have clauses. Nouns start with **lo** and end in its verb (like a single or a compound verb). Thus we can insert prepositions to nouns only before that verb:

>**lo pu kunti tumla ca purdi**  
>_What was a desert is now a garden._

So **pu** belongs to **lo kunti tumla** and **ca** belongs to **purdi** (as **lo pu kunti tumla** can't add **ca** in the end).

This doesn't contradict with using **be** after the verb since with **be** you change the verb: **bangu be mi** is considered one verb.

Placing prepositions after nouns binds them to outer verbs:

>**lo kunti tumla pu purdi**  
>_The desert was a garden._

### New nouns from places of the same verb

>**do dunda ti mi**  
>_You grant this to me._

>**ti se dunda do mi**  
>_This is granted by you to me._

dunda
: x1 grants, gives x2 to x3

We can swap the first two places round in the verb using **se** and thus change the place structure.

**do dunda ti mi** means exactly the same as **ti se dunda do mi**. The difference is solely in style.

You may want to change things around for different emphasis, for example, to mention the more important things in a sentence first. So the following pairs mean the same thing:

>**mi prami do**  
>_I love you._

>**do se prami mi**  
>_You are loved by me._

>**lo nu mi tadni la .lojban. cu xamgu mi**  
>_My study of Lojban is good for me._

xamgu
: to be good for (someone)

>**mi se xamgu lo nu mi tadni la .lojban.**  
>_For me it's good to study Lojban._

The same can be dont with nouns:

lo dunda
: those who give, givers, donors, donators

lo se dunda
: something that is given, gifts

As we know, when we add **lo** in front of a verb it becomes a noun. So

- **lo dunda** means _something(s) which could fit in the first place of **dunda**_
- **lo se dunda** means _something(s) which could fit in the second place of **dunda**_

Thus, in Lojban we don't need a separate word for _gift_. We reuse the same verb and save a lot of effort because of such clever design. Indeed, we can't imagine a gift without implying that someone gave it or will give it. When phenomena are interconnected Lojban reflects this.

For the ease of understanding and memorizing predicate words prefixed with **se** are put into the dictionary in entries for many verbs together with their definitions although you can figure out their meaning yourself.

### Changing other places in main verbs

**se** is the first particle in the series **se, te, ve, xe** (they go in alphabetical order):

- **se** changes round the first and second places
- **te** changes round the first and third places
- **ve**, the first and fourth, and
- **xe**, the first and fifth.

>**le nakni cu zbasu pa stizu lo mudri**  
>_He made a chair out of wood._

zbasu
: x1 builds, makes x2 out of x3

pa stizu
: a chair

lo mudri
: wood

>**lo mudri cu te zbasu le stizu le nakni**  
>_Wood is the material the chair is made of by him._

The **le nakni** has now moved to the third place in the sentence, and can now be dropped out without being missed if we are too lazy to specify who made the chair or we just don't know who made it:

>**lo mudri cu te zbasu le stizu**  
>_Wood is the material of the chair._

Similarly to our example with **lo se dunda** (_gift_) we can use **te**, **ve**, **xe** to get more words from other places of verbs:

klama
: x1 goes to x2 from x3 via x4 by means x5

Thus, we can derive that

lo klama
: a goer/goers

lo se klama
: destination place

lo te klama
: place of origin of the movement

lo ve klama
: route

lo xe klama
: vehicle

**lo xe klama** and the fifth place of **klama** can denote any means of movement like a car or your feet.

**se** is used a lot more than the other particles for swapping places.

### Free word order. Prepositions for places

Usually we don't need all the places of a verb, so we can omit the unnecessary ones by replacing them with **zo'e**. However, we can use _place tags_ - special prepositions to explicitly refer to a needed place.

>**mi prami do** is the same as   
>**fa mi prami fe do**  
> _I love you._  

- **fa** marks the first place of a verb (x1)
- **fe** - marks the second place (x2)
- **fi** - marks the third place (x3)
- **fo** - marks the fourth place (x4)
- **fu** - marks the fifth place (x5)

More examples:

>**mi klama fi le tcadu**  
>_I go from the city._

**fi** marks **le tcadu** as the third place of **klama** (the origin of movement). Without **fi**, the sentence would turn into **mi klama le tcadu** meaning _I go to the city._

>**mi pinxe fi pa kabri** is the same as  
>**mi pinxe zo'e pa kabri**   
>_I drink (something) from a cup._  

pinxe
: x1 drinks x2 from x3

>**mi tugni zo'e lo nu vitke lo rirni**  
>**mi tugni fi lo nu vitke lo rirni**  
>_I agree (with someone) about visiting parents._  

tugni
: x1 agrees with someone x2 about x3 (clause)

With place tags we can move places around:

>**fe pa cukta pu dunda fi pa nanla**  
>_Someone gave a book to a boy._

dunda
: x1 gives the gift x2 to x3

Here

- **pa cukta** = _a book_, we put it into the second place of **dunda**, what is given
- **pa nanla** = _boy_, we put it into the third place of **dunda**, the recipient.

As we can see in the last example we can't even reflect the order of words in its English translation.

Extensive use of place tags can make our speech harder to perceive but they allow for more freedom.

Unlike **se** series using place tags like **fa** doesn't change the place structure.

---

We can use place tags inside nouns by placing them after **be**:

>**lo dunda be fi lo nanla cu pendo mi**  
>_Who gives something to a boy is my friend._

---

Another option in placing nouns is that we can put all the nouns of one main verb in front of the verb (preserving their relative order). Because of this freedom we can say:

>**mi do prami** which is the same as  
>**mi prami do**  
> _I love you._  

>**ko kurji ko** is the same as  
>**ko ko kurji**  
> _Take care of yourself._  

The following clauses are also equal in meaning:

>**mi dunda pa plise do**  
>_I give an apple to you._

>**mi pa plise cu dunda do**  
>_I an apple give to you._

>**mi pa plise do dunda**  
>_I an apple to you give._

### Infinitives

Infinitives are verbs that are often prefixed with "to" in English. Examples include "I like to run" with "to run" being the infinitive.

>**pa mlatu cu djica lo ka pinxe**  
>_A cat wants to drink._

The particle **ka** works much like **nu** but it indicates that the noun on the left does or would do the action following **ka**. It makes the first noun of the outer verb (**djica** in this case) also the first omitted noun of the embedded verb started by **ka** (**pinxe** in this case) so you don't have to repeat this noun the second time.

Thus we can rewrite the sentence as

>**pa mlatu cu djica lo nu le mlatu cu pinxe**  
>`A cat wants that the cat drinks`  

The previous translation with **ka** sounds more natural and compact so using **ka** is preferred in such case.

Another example with a pronoun in the place of the first noun

>**mi djica lo ka pinxe**  
>_I want to drink._

>**mi djica lo nu mi pinxe**  
>`I want that I drink [literally]`  

Again the sentence with **ka** looks nicer.

Compare:

>**mi djica lo nu do pinxe**  
>_I want you to drink._  
>`I want that you drink [literally]`  

Here, the first pronoun of **djica** differs from the one from **pinxe** so we can't use **ka**.

It is also possible to use **ka** when we usually use the ending _\-ing_ in English:

>**mi gleki lo ka jinga**  
>_I'm glad of winning._

which is the same as

>**mi gleki lo nu mi jinga**  
>_I'm glad that I won._

Some verbs require only infinitives in some of their places. Definitions of such words mark such places with the term "property". For example,

cinmo
: x1 feels x2 (property of x1)

This means that the infinitive in the second place (x2) is applied to the first place (x1). Cases where infinitive is applied to other place are rare and are explained for corresponding verbs.

Note that only the first unfilled place of the embedded clause takes the meaning of the outer place:

>**mi djica lo ka do nelci**  
>_I want that you like me._

nelci
: x1 likes x2

Here, the first unfilled place is the second place of **nelci** thus it takes the value **mi** (_I_).

It is also possible to explicitly mark a plce to refer to by using the pronoun **ce'u**:

>**mi djica lo ka do nelci ce'u**  
>_I want that you like me._

Another example:

**mi cinmo lo ka xebni ce'u  
mi cinmo lo ka se xebni**  
_I feel like someone hates me.  
I feel being hated._

### Nouns of existence

Nouns starting with **lo** don't imply any particular objects:

>**xu do tavla lo na slabu be do**  
>_Do you talk to not familiar to you? (no particular person in mind is described)._

>**e'u mi jo'u do casnu bu'u lo drata**  
>_Let's discuss in another place (no particular place in mind)_

Objects in general are finely described using nouns with **lo**.

As opposed to them nouns starting with numbers like **pa mlatu** and **ci prenu** refer to new entities every time they are used:

>**ci mlatu cu citka re finpe**  
>_There are three cats, there are two fishes for each cat, and each cat eats two fishes._

Note that we apply nouns from left to the right: first we talk about the three cats and then we specify for each of the cats that it eats two fishes. So in fact there are 6 fishes.

### **da** - _there is something ..._

>**da tavla da**  
>_Someone talk to themselves._

>**da tavla da da**  
>_Someone talk to themselves about themselves._

The pronoun **da** is translated as _there is something/someone ..._ But unlike nouns of existence like **pa mlatu** we've just looked at if we use **da** the second time in the same clause it always refers to the same thing as the first **da**:

More examples:

>**mi tavla**  
>_I talk._

>**mi tavla da**  
>_There is someone I talk to._

tavla
: x1 talks to x2 about x3

mi nitcu lo mikce
: I need a doctor (implying "any doctor will do")

mi nitcu da poi mikce
: There is a doctor whom I need

Note the difference:

- **da** means _there is something/someone_, **da** always refers to the same entity when used more than once in the same clause.
- noun like **lo mlatu** (starting with **lo**) can refer to new entities every time it is used.
- noun like **pa mlatu** (with a bare number and without **lo**) is similar to using **pa da poi mlatu** but it can refer to new entities every time it is used.

### "_To have_"

The English verb _to have_ has several meanings.

>**pa da birka mi**  
>_I have an arm._  
>`There is something that is an arm of me`

birka
: x1 is an arm of x2

We use the same strategy for expressing family relationship:

**pa da bruna mi  
mi se bruna pa da**  
_Someone is my brother.  
I have one brother._    
>`There is someone who is a brother of me`

>**re bruna be mi cu clani**  
>_I have two brothers and they are tall._

clani
: x1 is long, tall

So we don't need the verb "to have" to denote such relationship. The same for other family members:

da mamta mi** or **mi se mamta da
: I have a mother.

da patfu mi** or **mi se patfu da
: I have a father.

da mensi mi** or **mi se mensi da
: I have a sister.

da panzi mi** or **mi se panzi da
: I have a child (or children).

panzi
: x1 is a child, offspring of x2

Note that using a number in front of **da** isn't necessary if context is enough.

---

Another meaning of _to have_ is _to keep_:

>**mi ralte pa gerku**  
>_I have a dog._  
>`I keep a dog`

>**mi ralte pa karce**  
>_I have a car._

ralte
: x1 keeps x2 in their possesion

---

If you own, possess something according to some law or documents you should use **ponse**:

>**mi ponse le karce**  
>_I own the car._

ponse
: x1 owns x2

## Lesson 3. Quoting. Questions. Interjections

### **sei**: comments to the text

The particle **sei** allows to insert into a clause a comment about our attitude about what is said in that clause:

>**do jinga sei mi gleki**  
>_You won! (I'm happy about that!)_

However:

>**do jinga sei la .ian. cu gleki**  
>_You won! (And Yan is happy about that!)_

Like with nouns formed with **lo** the clause formed with **sei** must end in a verb.

>**la .alis. cu prami sei la .bob. cu gleki la .kevin.**

Let's add brackets to make it more easily readable.

>**la .alis. cu prami (sei la .bob. cu gleki) la .kevin.**  
>_Alice loves (Bob is happy) Kevin._  
>_Alice loves Kevin (Bob is happy)._  

We can add more nouns to the verb with **be** and **bei** like we do for nouns:

>**do jinga sei mi zausku be fo la fircku**  
>_You won! (I'll post congrats on Facebook)_

zausku
: to praise

### Quotation marks

For quoting text we place quotation particle **lu** before the quote and place **li'u** after it. The result is a noun representing a quoted text:

>**mi cusku lu mi prami do li'u**  
>_I say "I love you."_

cusku
: x1 expresses/says x2 (quote) to audience x3

A nice feature of Lojban is that **lu** - «quote» and **li'u** - «unquote» marks are pronounceable. It is quite handy since in spoken Lojban you don't have to change intonation to show where a quoted text starts and ends.

However, in written text that quotes a conversation, the author often pays reader's attention to the content of quotations. In such cases **sei** is preferred.

We can also nest quotations, for example:

>**la .ian. pu cusku lu la .djein. pu cusku lu coi li'u mi li'u**  
>_Yan said "Jane said ‘Hello’ to me."_

which is similar to

>**la .ian. pu cusku lu la .djein. pu rinsa mi li'u**  
>_Yan said "Jane greeted me."_

Note that in Lojban we distinguish things and their names:

>**lu le munje li'u cu cmalu**  
>_"The universe" is small._

>**le munje na cmalu**  
>_The universe is not small._

le munje
: the universe, world

Here, the text _"the universe"_ is small whereas the universe is not.

---

Interjections and vocatives work like **sei** constructs:

>**je'u mi jinga sei le nakni cu cusku**  
>_Truly, "I won", he said._

As you can see **je'u** is not his words. It's your attitude to the clause. If you want to quote "**je'u mi jinga**" use quotation marks getting:

>**lu je'u mi jinga li'u se cusku le nakni**  
>_"Truly, I won", he said._

See the difference between the two examples?

Several common verbs related to talking:

>**le fetsi pu retsku lu do klama ma li'u**  
>_She asked "Where do you go?"_

>**mi pu spusku lu mi klama lo zdani li'u**  
>_I replied "I am going home."_

>**mi pu spuda lo se retsku be le fetsi lo ka spusku lu mi klama lo zdani li'u**  
>_I replied to her question by saying in reply "I am going home."_

spuda
: x1 replies to x2 by doing x3 (property of x1)

The remaining three verbs have identical place structure:

cusku
: x1 expresses/says x2 (quote) to audience x3

retsku
: x1 asks x2 (quote) to audience x3

spusku
: x1 replies/says answer x2 (quote) to audience x3

### **zo** — quoting one word

**zo** is a quotation marker, just like **lu**. However, **zo** quotes only one word immediately after it. This means it does not have an unquote word like **li'u**: we already know where the quotation ends. Thus we save two syllables making our speech more concise.

>**zo robin cmene mi**  
>_"Robin" is my name._  
>_My name is Robin._  

cmene
: x1 (quote) is a name of x2 ...

This is how you present yourself in Lojban using your Lojbanized name.If you have a name consisting of more than one verb word then use **lu … li'u**:

>**lu robin djonson li'u cmene mi**  
>_Robin Johnson is my name._

Another way is to use **me**.

>**mi me la robin djonson**  
>_I'm Robin Johnson._

Note that the first place of **cmene** is a quote, a text. Thus, we use not **la** (prefix for names) but **lu ... li'u** or **zo** to make a quote and fill the first place of **cmene** with it. Thus, **mi me la robin** but

>**zo robin cmene mi**  
>`"Robin" (quotation) is a name of me`

  <figcaption>
  <b>lo nanmu</b><br/>
  <i>a man (male human)</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

English also has a number of _wh-_ questions — _who_, _what_ etc. In Lojban we use one word for all of these: **ma**. This is like an instruction to fill in the missing place. For example:

>**— do klama ma**  
>**— la .london.**  
>_— Where are you going?_  
>— London._  

>**— ma klama la .london.**  
>**— la .kevin.**  
>_— Who's going to London?_  
>_— Kevin._  

>**— mi dunda ma do**  
>**— lo cukta**  
>_— I give what to you?_ (probably meaning _What was it I was supposed to be giving you?_)  
>_— The book._  

It is quite common to use **ma** with relative clauses:

>**— do xabju ma noi gugde**  
>**— lo gugde'usu**  
>_— In what country do you live?_  
>_— USA_  
— `You inhabit what, which is a country?`  
— `USA`

xabju
: to inhabit (some place)

**mo** is like **ma**, but questions the main verb, not a noun — it's like English _What does_ x _do?_ or _What is_ x*?* (remember, Lojban doesn't force you to distinguish between being and doing!)

We can see **mo** as asking someone to describe the relationship between the nouns in the question.

>**— do mo**  
>_— How do you do? What's up?_  
>`—You are what, you do what? [literally]`  

This is the most common way of asking _How do you do?_, _Howdy?_ in Lojban. Some possible answers:

>**— mi gleki**    
>_— I'm happy._  

>**— mi kanro**  
—_— I'm healthy._  

Another way of asking _How do you do?_:

>**— do cinmo lo ka mo**  
>_— How do you feel (emotionally)?_  

----

>**— gleki**  
>_— Happy._  

>**— tatpi**  
>_— Tired._

cinmo
: x1 feels x2 (property of x1)

Other examples:

>**ti mo**  
>_What is this?_

>**la .meilis. cu mo**  
>_Who is Mei Li? / What is Mei Li? / What is Mei Li doing?_

Possible answers depending on context:

- **ninmu**: _She's a woman._
- **jungo**: _She's Chinese._
- **pulji**: _She's a police officer._
- **sanga**: _She's a singer_ or _She's singing._

>**do mo la .kevin.**  
>_What are you to Kevin?_  
>`You are what (you do what) to Kevin.`

The answer depends on the context. Possible answers to this question are:

- **nelci**: _I like him._
- **pendo**: _I am his friend_
- **prami**: _I adore/am in love with him._
- **xebni**: _I hate him._
- **fengu**: _I'm angry with him._
- **cinba**: _I kissed him_

Note once again that the time is not important here: just as **cinba** can mean _kiss_, _kissed_, _will kiss_ and so on, **mo** does not ask a question about any particular time.

To differentiate between _to do_ and _to be someone or something_ we use additional verbs with **ma**:

>**la meilis cu zukte ma**  
>`Mei Li does what?`  

>**la meilis cu zukte lo ka lumci**  
>_Mei Li is does cleaning._

zukte
: x1 does x2 (property of x1)

lumci
: to clean (something)

>**do du ma**    
>`You are who?`

>**mi du lo ctuca**  
>_I am the teacher._

Combining prepositions or relative clauses with **ma** can give us other useful questions:

<table class="wikitable">
<tbody><tr>
<th>word
</th>
<th>meaning
</th>
<th><tt>[literally]</tt>
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ca ma</b>
</td>
<td>When?
</td>

</td>
<td>pertaining to what or whom
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>lo mlatu poi mo</b>
</td>
<td>Which cat? Which kind of cat?
</td>
<td>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

**pe ma** is attached only to nouns:

>**lo penbi pe ma cu zvati lo jubme**  
>_Whose pen is on the table?_

### Number questions

>**lo xo mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_How many cats drink milk?_

>**mu**  
>_Five._

The word **xo** means _How many?_ and thus asks for a number. The full answer will be:

>**lo mu mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_5 cats drink milk._

So the person being asked is supposed to put an appropriate value in place of **xo**.

A few more examples:

>**lo xo botpi cu kunti**  
>_How many of the bottles are empty?_

>**lo xo prenu cu klama ti**  
>_How many people come here?_

>**do ralte lo xo gerku**  
>_How many dogs do you keep?_

### Verbs of facts

Consider the example:

>**mi djuno lo du'u do stati**  
>_I know that you are smart._

djuno
: x1 knows x2 (proposition) about x3

>**mi jimpe lo du'u do pu citka**  
>_I understand that you were eating._

jimpe
: x1 understands x2 (proposition) about x3

In places that describe facts the particle **du'u** is used (instead of **nu**).

**djuno** (_to know_) and **jimpe** (_to understand_) describe facts. It'd be stupid to say _I understand that you were eating but in fact you weren't._ However, for verbs describing events usual **nu** is used:

>**mi sruma lo nu do pu citka**  
>_I assume that you were eating._

And here, I assume one thing but it doesn't imply a true fact:

>**mi sruma lo nu do pu citka i ku'i do pu na citka**  
>_I assume that you were eating. But you weren't eating._

Note that the clause started with **du'u** doesn't have to be true:

>**lo du'u do mlatu cu jitfa**  
>_That you are a cat is false._

jitfa
: x1 (proposition) is false

Where to use **du'u** and whereto use **nu**? You may look into the dictionary:

- The term *(proposition)* marks places where **du'u** is recommended.
- The term  *(clause)* marks places where **nu** is recommended.

If by mistake you use **nu** instead of **du'u** you will still be understood. But usually people speaking fluent Lojban distinguish these particles.

### Indirect questions

>**mi djuno lo du'u ma kau tadni la .lojban.**  
>_I know who is studying Lojban._

This is called an indirect question. The word _who_ here is not a request for information, there's no question mark. The answer is presumed. In fact you yourself know the answer to the question _Who is learning Lojban?_

**kau** is an interjection that we put after a question word telling that its an indirect question.

If I ask you the question **ma tadni la .lojban.**, you know what value to fill in the **ma** slot with: **la .kevin.** So you could just say

>**ma tadni la .lojban.**  
>_Who is studying Lojban?_

>**mi djuno lo du'u ma kau tadni la .lojban.**  
>_I know who is studying Lojban. I know the identity of the person studying Lojban._

>**mi djica lo nu ma tadni la .lojban.**  
>_Who do I want to study Lojban?_  
>`I want who to study Lojban?`

This can never be an indirect question: it is asking for an answer (even if you're doing it rhetorically).

You can put it after other question words:

>**mi djuno lo du'u lo xo kau prenu cu tadni la .lojban.**  
>_I know how many people study Lojban._

### Indirect quotations (reported speech)

A clause like _Alice said "Michelle said “Hello” to me"_ can also be expressed in a rather more subtle way:

>**la .alis. pu cusku zo'e pe lo nu la .micel. pu rinsa le fetsi**  
>_Alice said something about Michelle greeting her before._  
>`Alice said something about the event of Michelle greeted her.`

or a bit shorter:

>**la .alis. pu cusku lo se du'u la .micel. pu rinsa le fetsi**  
>_Alice said that Michelle had greeted her._

The combination **se du'u** allows expressing indirect speech.

Here are the examples of verbs related to talking when using reported speech:

>**le fetsi pu retsku lo se du'u mi klama makau**  
>_She asked where I was going._

>**mi pu spusku lo se du'u mi klama lo zdani**  
>_I replied that I was going home._

>**mi pu spuda lo se retsku be le fetsi lo ka spusku lo se du'u mi klama lo zdani**  
>_I replied to her question by saying in reply that I was going home._

Questions in reported speech:

>**mi pu cusku lo se du'u ma tadni la .lojban.**  
>_Who did I say is studying Lojban?_  
>`I said who is studying Lojban?`

Thus, Lojban has several words for _that…_, depending on what sort of thing is meant.

- If _that_ describes what can be seen, heard, what happens, use **nu**.
- If _that_ describes what you think, some fact or information, use **du'u**.
- If _that_ describes what you say, use **se du'u**.

### Emotional interjections

We know such interjection as **a'o** (_I hope_). There are interjections expressing other emotional states. They are similar to smileys like ;-) or :-( but in Lojban we can be more specific about our emotions still remaining concise in our speech.

Here are examples of widely used emotional interjections:

>**do jinga ui**  
>_You won! (I'm happy about that!)_

**ui** (pronounced as English "we") expresses happiness

Interjections work like **sei** with their clauses. **ui** means the same as **sei mi gleki** so we could as well say **do jinga sei mi gleki** meaning the same (although it's a bit more lengthy).

>**ie tu mlatu**  
>_Yes, that is a cat._

>**ie nai i tu na mlatu**  
>_No, I don't agree. That is not a cat._

**ie** as in like _yes_ = _Yeah! Aye!_ (agreement)

**ie nai** = disagreement

>**.ai mi vitke do**  
>_I'm going to visit you._

**.ai** as in _high_ = _I'm going to…_ (intent)

>**.au do kanro**  
>_I wish you were healthy._

**.au** (pronounced as in _how_) = desire

>**.a'o do clira klama**  
>_I hope you come early._

**.a'o** = I hope.

>**.ei mi ciska lo xatra**  
>_I should write a letter._

**.ei** as in _hey_ = _I should …_ (obligation)

>**i'e do pu gunka lo vajni**  
>_Very good! You did an important work._

**i'e** = _Fine!_ (approval)

>**.o'u tu mlatu**  
>_Oh, that's only a cat._

**.o'u** = _Phew!_ (relaxation)

In this case you probably thought that was something dangerous but it's only a cat so you are saying **.o'u**.

>**.u'i ti zmiku**  
>_Ha-ha, this is a robot._

**.u'i** = _Ha-ha!_ (amusement)

You can add or remove interjections to/from a sentence without the risk of breaking it.

Any word that starts with a vowel is prefixed with a dot in Lojban. So the correct spelling is **.a'o** and so on. It's common to omit dots. We will do this later in this course for brevity. However, while speaking you should always show this dot by making a short pause before saying such word to prevent merging two neighboring words together into one.

Like with **xu** or **sei**\-clauses we can add interjections after any noun, pronoun or verb thus expressing our attitude towards that part of the sentence.

### Urging interjections

A special group of interjections (in English called "imperative/hortative" interjections) make instigations, commands, requests. among which we already know **.e'o**:

>**.e'a do klama lo nenri**  
>_You may come in._

**.e'a** = _I allow, you may …_ (permission)

lo nenri
: an interior, what is inside

>**.e'e do zukte**  
>_C'mon, do it!_

**.e'e** = _Come on!_ (encourgament, instigation, provokation)

>**.e'o mi ciksi da poi mi cusku djica**  
>_Please, let me explain what I want to say._

**.e'o** = _Please …_ (request)

>**.e'i do zutse doi lo verba**  
>_Sit down, child!_

**.e'i** = _Do that!_ (command)

>**.e'u do pinxe lo jisra**  
>_I suggest that you drink the juice. You'd better drink the juice._

**.e'u** = _Let's_ (suggestion)

### **ko** for quicker urges

>**do bajra**  
>_You run._

>**bajra**  
>_Someone runs._

In English the verb itself is a command:

>_Run!_

In Lojban **bajra** as a sentence means _Someone runs_ (or _is running_ / _was running_ and so on depending on context). **bajra** can also mean a command _Do run!_ but sometimes context isn't enough to make you decide whether it's an urge to run or simply a statement of the fact that someone runs or is running.

The pronoun **ko** is used instead of **do** to make requests, suggestions, commands.

>**ko bajra**  
>_Run! Do run! Do it so that you run!_

**ko** is simply a more vague alternative to **do .e'o**, **do .e'u**, **do .e'i**.

It's perfectly fine to say a more precise

>**do .e'o bajra**  
>_You, please run!_

putting the emphasis in our politeness onto **do** (_you_).

Moving **ko** in a clause moves command/request to that part, for example:

>**nelci ko**  
>_Make it so you are liked by someone!_

nelci
: to like (something or someone)

As you can see we have to restructure this clause in English which still sounds weird, but you could use it in Lojban in the sense of _Try to make a good impression._

Note that **prami** corresponds to English _to love_ while **nelci** corresponds to English _to like_.

We can even have several **ko** in one sentence:

>**ko kurji ko**  
>_Take care of yourself._

kurji
: to take care (of someone)

### Discursive interjections

>**.i mi venfu do .e ji'a lo cmalu gerku pe do**  
>_I'll get you and your little dog, too!_

ji'a
: additionally, also

**ji'a** means that there exist others who also are the same (_you_ in this case) or who do the same.

>**mi si'a nelci do**    
>`I too like you`

>**— mi nelci lo mlatu**  
>**— mi si'a nelci lo mlatu**  
>_— I like cats._  
>_— I like cats too (Me too)._

si'a
: similarly, too

**si'a** denotes that something is similar while being different in other unmentioned aspects.

### Structure of interjections: **nai**, **sai**, **pei**, **dai**

Interjection can consist of

1.  the root like **ui** (_Yay!_)
2.  then suffixes like **pei**, **dai**, **zo'o**:
    - **ui zo'o** = _Yay! (kidding, I'm not actually happy)_
3.  both the root and each of the suffixes can be modified with scalar particles like **nai**:
    - **ui nai** = _Alas!_
    - **ui nai zo'o** = _Alas! (kidding, I'm not serious in this feeling)_
    - **ui nai zo'o nai** = _Alas, I'm not kidding, I feel unhappy_

Some examples of how scalar particles work.

1.  **ju'o** = _interjection: I'm sure (certaintty)_
2.  **ju'o cu'i** = _interjection: maybe, perhaps (uncertainty)_
3.  **ju'o nai** = _interjection: I have no idea!_

Common examples of interjections:

- interjection with bare root:
    - **ju'o le bruna co'i klama** = _I'm sure, the brother has come._
- scalar particle **cu'i** turns bare interjection into the middle attitude:
    - **ju'o cu'i le bruna co'i klama** = _Maybe the brother has come, I'm not sure._
- scalar particle **nai** turns interjection into the opposite attitude:
    - **ju'o nai le bruna co'i klama** = _Maybe the brother has come, maybe not, I have no idea_
    - Similarly, **ui** is _Whee! Yay!_ while **ui nai** means _Alas!_
    - Precise meanings of interjections that are meaningful with their scalar particles **cu'i** and **nai** are given in the dictionary.
- scalar particle **sai** denotes strong intensity of interjection:
    <dl><dt>.u'i sai</dt><dd>Ha-ha-ha!</dd></dl>

Vocatives too can be modified with scalar particles:

ki'e sai do
: Thank you a lot!

Suffixes are added after the root of interjection (together with its scalar particles if we used them):

- interjection suffix **pei** turns interjection into a question.

    >**— .au pei do e mi klama lo zarci**  
    >**— .au cu'i**  
    >_— Do you want that you and I go to the store?_  
    >_— Meh, I don't have any preferences._  

    >**— ie pei lo ninmu cu melbi**  
    >**— ie**  
    >_— The woman is pretty, isn't she?_  
    >_— Yeah._  

- interjection suffix **dai** shows another's feelings, not feelings of the speaker:

    >**ui nai dai do na co'i jinga**  
    >_You must be sad, you haven't won._

    >**.a'u**  
    >_That's interesting!_

    >**.a'u dai**  
    >_That must have been interesting for you!_
- Bare interjections express the attitude of the speaker. **ei do cliva** means not _You ought to leave_, but _I feel the obligation for you to leave_. **dai** shows that the speaker is empathizing someone else's feelings.

    >**.ei dai do cliva**  
    >_You feel the obligation for yourself to leave._  

Note that interjections don't necessarily show attitude towards the speakers themselves. Instead, they express speakers' attitude towards other things.

- interjection suffix **zo'o** marks the attitude as expressed not seriously:

    >**e'u zo'o do pinxe ti**  
    >_I suggest that you drink it (kidding)._  

    **zo'o** is used just like the smiley-face in e-mail, to indicate that you're being humorous when saying something, and it's used for much the same reason. Although, simleys can be ambiguous, and **zo'o** has only one meaning, which is handy.

- Suffixes can also be modified with scalar particles:

    >**ie zo'o nai**  
    >_I agree (not kidding)._  

    **zo'o nai** is used to show that the information is not a joke:

- Suffixes can be used on its own:

    - **pei** when used alone asks for any interjection that the listener would feel appropriate:

        >**— pei lo lunra cu crino**  
        >**— .ie nai**  
        >_— The moon is green (what is your feeling about it?)_  
        >_— I disagree._  

- For other suffixes they mean that the root interjection **ju'a** (_I state_) was omitted:

    >**zo'o do kusru**  
    >**ju'a zo'o do kusru**  
    >_You are cruel (kidding)._

    <dl><dt>ju'a</dt><dd>interjection: I state (don't confuse it with **ju'o** (I'm sure))</dd></dl>

Note how an emotion changes to its opposite with **nai** and to the middle emotion using **cu'i**.

Why are some cells of interjections with **cu'i** and **nai** empty? Because English lacks concise ways of expressing such emotions.

What is more, most of such interjections are used quite seldom.

These tables might help you understand their design.

### Combining interjections

>**iu ui nai**  
>_I am unhappily in love._

>**ue ui do jinga**  
>_Oh, you won! I'm so happy!_

jinga
: to win

In this case the victory was unprobable, I'm surprised and happy at the same time.

Interjections (unlike scalar particles and interjection suffixes) don't modify each other:

>**ue ui do jinga**  
>**ui ue do jinga**  
>_Oh, you won! I'm so happy!_  

Here two interjections modify the same construct (the whole sentence) but they don't modify each other so their order is not important.

>**pei .u'i lo mlatu cu sutra plipe**  
>_(What do you feel?) Heh, the cat is quickly jumping._

Here **pei** is used alone and doesn't modify **.u'i** which is put after it.

### Forgot to put an interjection at the beginning?

>**do pu sidju mi .ui**  
>_You help me (yay!)_

**.ui** modifies only the pronoun **mi** putting the attitude only to _me_.

>**ui do pu sidju mi**  
>_Yay, you helped me._

What if we forgot to add **.ui** at the beginning of this clause?

We can start a new sentence with **i bo** and then put the interjection:

>**do pu sidju mi i bo ui**  
>_You helped me, yay!_

## Lesson 4. Practice

Now we know most crucial parts of the grammar and can start accumulating new words through situations.

In this dialogue most important verbs for human senses have been used. Here are their place structures together with more verbs and more examples.

#### Vision

viska
: x1 sees x2 (object, form, color)

skari
: x1 is an object with the color x2

tarmi
: x1 is the form of x2

>**mi viska lo plise**  
>_I see an apple._

**mi viska lo tarmi be lo plise**  
>**i le plise cu se tarmi lo cukla**  
>_I see the form of an apple._  
>_The apple is round._  

>**mi viska lo se skari be lo plise**  
>**i le plise cu skari lo xunre**  
>_I see the color of the apple._  
>_The apple is colored red._  

Notice that we can both say _see the form of an apple_ and _see an apple_.

#### Hearing

tirna
: x1 hears x2 (object or sound)

>**mi tirna pa palta**  
>_I hear a plate_  

>**mi tirna lo sance be pa palta poi ca'o porpi**  
>**i le palta cu se sance lo cladu**  
>_I hear the sound of a plate that is falling._  
>_It sounds loud._

pa palta
: a plate

cladu
: x1 is loud

tolycladu
: x1 is quite in sound

tonga
: x1 is a tone of x2

We can use **cladu** and similar words directly:

>**mi tirna lo cladu**  
>_I hear something loud._  

>**mi tirna lo tolycladu**   
>_I hear something quite in sound._  

mi tirna lo tonga be pa palta poi farlu
: I hear the tone of the plate falling down.

Similarly to vision, we can say _hear a sound_ and _hear something producing the sound_:

>**— do tirna ma noi sance**  
>**— lo zgike**  
>_— What sound do you hear?_  
>_— A music._  

>**— do tirna lo sance be ma**  
>**— lo plise poi farlu**  
>_— You hear a sound of what?_  
>_— An apple that has fallen down._  

#### Sense of smell

sumne
: x1 smells x2 (odor)

panci
: x1 is an odor of x2 (object)

>**mi sumne le flora**  
>_I smell the flower._

>**mi sumne lo panci be lo za'u pa flora**  
>_I smell the odor of flowers._

>**mi sumne lo panci be pa plise**  
>**i le plise cu se panci lo za'u flora**  
>_I smell the odor of the apple._  
>_The apple smells of flowers._  

Note that English confuses smelling an odor and smelling an object that produces that odor. We say _to smell an apple_, _the apple smells of flowers (has the scent of flowers)_. This two-fold distinction is important because an apple produces aromatic particles that are distinct from the apple itself. The same for a falling plate and its sound — we may not want to mix them.

In Lojban we can easily separate between those cases like shown in the examples above.

#### Sense of taste

smaka
: x1 smacks, tastes x2 (taste)

tasta
: x1 is a taste of x2

>**mi smaka lo plise**  
>_I taste the apple._

>**mi smaka lo tasta be lo plise**  
>**i le plise cu se tasta lo kukte**  
>_I taste the taste of the apple._  
>_The apple tastes sweet._  

#### Sense of touch

palpi
: x1 palpates, touch-feels x2 (surface)

sefta
: x1 is a surface of x2

>**mi palpi lo plise**  
>_I palpate, touch-feel the apple._  

>**mi palpi lo sefta be lo plise**  
>**i le plise cu se sefta lo xutla**  
>_I touch feel the surface of the apple._  
>_The apple has a smooth surface._  

#### Pain

>**mi cortu lo birka be mi**  
>_I feel pain in my arm._  
>_My arm hurts._  

>**mi cortu lo cidni**  
>_I feel pain in my knee, my knee hurts._

cortu
: x1 feels pain in x2 (organ, part of x1's body)

cidni
: x1 is a knee of x2

#### Perception in general

We can also use the vague **ganse** - _to sense_.

ganse
: x1 senses x2 (object, event) by means x3

ganse lo glare
: to feel the heat

ganse lo lenku
: to feel the cold

>**mi ganse lo plise**  
>_I sense an apple._

>**mi ganse lo tarmi be lo plise**  
>**i le plise cu se tarmi lo cukla**  
>_I sense the form of an apple._  
>_The apple is round._  

Some words can be used with different sensory verbs. For example, we can

viska lo sefta
: to see the surface

palpi lo sefta
: to palpate the surface

### Colors

Different language use different sets of words to denote colors. Some languages just use compare the color of objects with colors of other "prototype" objects. In Lojban we use all the options:

>**ti xunre**  
>_This is red._

xunre
: x1 is red

>**ti skari lo xunre**  
>_This is red. This has the color or red things._

>**ti skari lo ciblu**  
>_This has the color of blood._

lo ciblu
: blood

Below are some examples with colors that follow those of English language. Other verbs for colors can be used, they would reflect how people speaking other languages are used to classify things.

>**lo tsani cu xunre ca lo cerni**  
>_The sky is red in the morning._

lo tsani
: the sky

>**i lo solri cu simlu lo ka narju**  
>_The sun seems to be orange._  

lo solri

>**i ma nuzba**

Note that the second place of **bilma** describes symptoms like **lo ka cortu lo galxe** = _to have pain in the throat_

The third place is the name of the disease leading to those symptoms: Obviously, you may fill any place of **bilma**.

### Human body

se xadni

Note that **panzi** can be applied to grown-up children of someone

verba
: x1 is a child, immature person of age x2 (clause)

panzi
: x1 is a child, offspring of x2

**verba** doesn't necessarily talk of it as of a family member:

>**pa bersa be pa pendo be mi cu verba lo nanca be li ci**  
>_The son of my friend is a child of three years old._

citno
: x1 is young

laldo
: x1 is old, aged

lo ninmu
: women

lo nanmu
: men

lo nixli
: girls

lo nanla
: boys

lo remna
: humans

Note that **lo prenu** means _people_, _persons_. In fairy tales and fantastic stories not only humans (**lo remna**) but animals or alien beings from other planets can be persons.

These words can be used for describing both animals and humans:

lo fetsi
: female

lo nakni

## Lesson 5. Prepositions, **da**, their relative position

### How prepositions refer to the clause?

- Some prepositions like those that describe tense connect the current clause with the one in the noun after them:

>**mi cadzu ca lo nu lo cipni cu vofli**  
>_I walk when birds fly._  

cadzu
: ... walks

lo cipni
: bird/birds

vofli
: ... flies

>**mi pu cadzu fa'a lo rirxe**  
>_I walked towards a river._  

>**mi pu cadzu se ka'a lo rirxe**  
>_I walked to a river._  

se ka'a
: going to ...

fa'a
: directly towards ...

Prepositions don't remove ordered places (**fa**, **fe**, **fi**, **fo**, **fu**) from the verb:

>**mi klama se ka'a lo rirxe lo dinju**  
>**mi klama fe lo rirxe .e lo dinju**  
>_I go to a river, to a house._  

Here, the first example uses **se ka'a** to connect **lo rirxe** and then the second place of **klama** follows being filled with **lo dinju**. It's the same as just filling the second place of **klama** two times, that is connecting them with **.e** - _and_.

However, **se ka'a** is nice when applied to other verbs like **cadzu** in a previous example.

- Some prepositions describe relations of the first place of the clause with the noun after the preposition:

>**mi jinga se rai lo ka clani**  
>_I win being the tallest one._  

se rai
: preposition from **se traji**: being most in ...

Here x1 of the clause corresponds to the most one in comparison specified after **se rai**.

- Finally, some prepositions describe relations of the first place of the clause and the clause itself with the noun after the preposition:

>**lo fragari cu se nelci mi te rai lo jbari**  
>_Out of berries, I like strawberries most._  

te rai
: preposition from **te traji**: preferring out of ...

lo fragari
: strawberries

lo jbari
: berries

x1 of the clause describes the most one in this comparison, the clause itself describes the comparison.

The dictionary explains such tricky cases where the relation defined by the preposition might pose difficulty. In practice, the relation is often clear from the examples provided.

### Using **ne** + preposition. **se mau** - _more than ..._

>**mi ne se mau do cu melbi**  
>_I am prettier than you._

se mau
: preposition from **se zmadu**: more than; the clause itself describes the comparison

This example is similar to

>**mi zmadu do lo ka melbi**  
>_I exceed you in prettiness._  

In other words, the main verb **melbi** is similar to the third place of **zmadu**, which specifies the comparison criteria. Two more examples:

>**mi prami do ne se mau la doris**  
>_I love you more than Doris._  

>**mi ne se mau la doris cu prami do**  
>_I love you more than Doris does._  
>_I love you more than Doris loves you._   
>`I (more than Doris) love you.`

More examples:

>**mi nelci lo pesxu ne se mau lo ladru**  
>_I like jam more than milk._

lo pesxu
: jam

>**lo pesxu cu zmadu lo ladru lo ka mi nelci**  
>_I like jam more than milk._  
>`Jam exceeds milk in how much I like it.`

And now an interesting sentence:

> _Bob likes Betty more than Mary._

It can mean two different things in English!

1.  Bob likes Betty and he likes Mary less.
2.  Bob likes Betty but Mary likes Betty too, though not as much as Bob does!

Do we compare Betty with Mary in how Bob likes them?

Or instead we compare Bob with Mary in how they like Betty?

English is ambiguous in this regard.

However, **se mau** always compares the noun after it with the first place of the clause we know what we get:

>**la bob ne se mau la maris cu nelci la betis**  
>**la bob cu nelci la betis se mau la maris**  
>_Bob (compared to Mary) likes Betty more. Mary likes Betty less._  

>**la betis cu se nelci la bob se mau la maris**  
>_Betty is loved by Bob more than Mary. Bob likes Mary less._

### Comparisons: "_equal_", "_the same_"

>**mi dunli lo mensi be mi lo ka clani i ku'i mi na du le mensi**  
>_I am as long as my sister. But I'm not her._  
>`I equal the sister of me in length. But i am not identical to the sister.`

dunli
: x1 (any type) is equal to x2 (any type) in x3 (property of x1 and x2 with {kau})

du
: x1 (any type) is identical to x2 (any type)

**dunli** compares two places for a single property, while **du** compares for identity. My sister and I are the same height, but we are not the same person. Clark Kent and Superman have different admirers, but they are the same person.

The same goes for another two verbs:

>**mi frica do lo ka nelci ma kau**  
>_We differ from each other in what we like._  
>`I differ from you in liking what.`

>**lo drata be mi cu kakne lo ka sidju**  
>_Someone other than me is able to help._

frica
: x1 (any type) differs from x2 (any type) in x3 (property of x1 and x2 with {kau})

drata
: x1 (any type) is not the same as x2 (any type)

### Preposition **tai** - _like ..._

The preposition **tai** leads to different meanings whether it's applied to a clause or to a noun with **ne**:

>**le nanmu ne tai do cadzu**  
>_The man walks like you._

>**le nanmu pu cadzu tai lo ka bevri lo tilju**  
>_The man walked as if he was carrying something heavy._

bevri
: x1 carries x2

The infinitive starting with **lo ka** always refers to the first place of the clause, **le nanmu** in this case.

### The concept of _only_

>**mi se steci lo ka nelci lo badna**  
>_I'm the only one who likes bananas._

A more precise one:

>**mi se steci lo ka nelci lo badna vau lo pendo be mi**  
>_I'm the only one who likes bananas among my friends._

se steci
: x1 is the only one in x2 (property of x1) among x3

Note that this example implies that you are a friend of yourself :) Otherwise, please, use an even more precise statement:

>**mi se steci lo ka nelci lo badna vau mi jo'u lo pendo be mi**  
>_I'm the only one who likes bananas among the group of me and my friends._

>**na ku mi se steci lo ka nelci lo badna**  
>_It's not just me who likes bananas._

It's also possible to rephrase this using **.e no drata be** (_and nothing different from ..._):

>**mi e no drata be mi cu nelci lo badna**  
>_I and no one else likes bananas._

One more interesting example:

>**lo troci cu se steci lo ka snada**  
>_Only the one who tries succeeds._  
>`Who tries is the only one who succeeds.`

>**lo zukte be lo ka troci e no drata be ri cu fliba**  
>_The only who only tries fails._  
>`The one who does attempts and nothing but it fails.`

troci
: x1 tries to do x2 (property of x1)

snada
: x1 succeeds in doing x2 (property of x1)

fliba
: x1 fails in doing x2 (property of x1)

And one more solution:

>**ro snada pu troci**  
>_Everyone who succeeds tried._

As you can see, Lojban offers different methods of saying the same, some of which can significantly differ from English forms.

### "_Most_", "_many_" and "_too much_"

Words like _most_ and _many_ are also numbers in Lojban:

<td> <i>more than…</i>
</td></tr>

<td> <i>too many</i>
</td></tr></tbody></table>

Some examples:

>**su'e re no prenu ba klama**  
>_No more than 20 people will come._

>**su'o pa prenu cu prami do**  
>_At least one person loves you._

### _never_ - **no roi**, _always_ - **ro roi**

Prepositions specifying the number of times:

- **no roi** = _never_
- **pa roi** = _once_
- **re roi** = _twice_
- **ci roi** = _thrice_

...

- **so'i roi** = _many times_
- **so'u roi** = _a few times_
- **du'e roi** = _too many times_
- **ro roi** = _always_

>**mi du'e roi klama lo zarci**  
>_I go to the market too often._

zarci
: x1 is a market

>**mi pu re roi klama lo zarci**  
>_I went to the market twice._

Without **pu** the construct **re roi** may mean that once I went to the market but the second time I will be there only in the future. These particles can be used with a noun after them:

>**mi klama ti pa roi ro jeftu**  
>_I come here one every week._

### _for the first time_ - **pa re'u**, _for the last time_ - **ro re'u**

- **pa re'u** = _for the first time_
- **re re'u** = _for the second time_

...

- **za'u re'u** = _again_
- **ro re'u** = _for the last time_

The particle **re'u** works like **roi** but tells for which time this event happens.

Compare:

>**mi pa roi vitke lo muzga**  
>_I visited the museum once._

>**mi pa re'u vitke lo muzga**  
>_I visited the museum for the first time._

>**mi za'u roi vitke lo muzga**  
>_I visited the museum more times._

>**mi za'u re'u vitke lo muzga**  
>_I visited the museum again._

>**mi za'u pa roi vitke lo muzga**  
>_I visited the museum more than once._

>**mi za'u pa re'u vitke lo muzga**  
>_I visited the museum not for the first time (maybe for the second/third etc.))_

vitke
: to visit (somebody or something)

Note the difference between:

za'u re'u
: again, more than the known from context number of times (e.g. more than expected or more that other already know)

za'u pa re'u
: not for the first time (the number of times is compared to number 1, hence no context is needed)

re re'u
: two times (same here, no context is needed, and even the exact number of times is given)

### Prepositions: their location within a clause

>**lo nu tcidu ca nandu**  
>_Reading is now difficult._

>**ca ku lo nu tcidu cu nandu**  
>_Now reading is difficult._

Bare prepositions without arguments after them can be moved around the sentence by adding **ku** after them.

**ku** prevents the following nouns from attaching to such prepositions. **ca lo nu tcidu** would mean _when reading_.

Here are several places where preposition can go.

- preposition modifies the clause to the right of it:
  - **ca ku mi citka** - _Now I eat._ Adverb, i.e. preposition with a particle **ku**
  - **ca lo cabdei mi citka** - _Today I eat_. Preposition with a noun after it.
  - **mi ca citka** - _I now eat._ Tense, i.e. preposition before the main verb and without a noun.
- Preposition is applied to the whole clause:
  - **mi citka ca** - _I eat now._ Tense, preposition at the end of the clause.

### Several prepositions in a clause (scope)

>**mi speni**  
>_I am married, I have a wife or a husband._

>**mi co'a speni**  
>_I get married._

>**mi mo'u speni**  
>_I am widowed._

mo'u
: preposition: the event is finished

Compare:

>**mi mo'u co'a speni**  
>_I am newlywed._  
>`I finished becoming a married person.`

>**mi co'a mo'u speni**  
>_I get widowed._  
>`I become finishing being married.`

If there are several prepositions in one clause, the rule is that we read them from left to right, thinking it as a so called _imaginary journey_. We begin at an implied point in time and space (the speaker's "now and here" if no noun follows), and then follow the prepositions one after another from left to right.

Let's take **mi mo'u co'a speni**.

**mo'u** means that an event is complete. Which event? The event **co'a speni** - to become married. Hence, **mi mo'u co'a speni** means _I finish the process of the becoming married_, i.e. _I am newlywed._

We say in such case that **co'a speni** is within the "scope" of **mo'u**.

In **mi co'a mo'u speni** the order or event is different.

First, it is said that an event started (**co'a**), then it is stated that it is an event of finishing being married. Hence, **mi co'a mo'u speni** means _I get widowed_.

We can say that here **mo'u speni** is within the "scope" of **co'a**.

Another example with the preposition **so'i roi**:

>**mi co'a so'i roi citka**  
>_I started eating many times._

>**mi so'i roi co'a citka**  
>_Many times I started to eat._

Examples with tenses:

>**mi pu ba klama lo cmana**  
>_It happened before I went to the mountain._  
>`I in past: in future: go to the mountain.`

>**mi ba pu klama lo cmana**  
>_It will happen after I went to the mountain._  
>`I in future: in past: go to the mountain.`

The rule of reading prepositions from the left to the right can be overriden by connecting prepositions with the conjunction **ce'e**:

>**mi ba ce'e pu klama lo cmana**  
>_I went and will go to the mountain._  
>`I in future and in past: go to the mountain.`

>**mi cadzu ba lo nu mi citka ce'e pu lo nu mi sipna**  
>_I walk after I eat and before I sleep._

#### Using prepositions together with **da** and nouns that start with numbers

Like with prepositions the position of **da** matters:

>**mi ponse da**  
>_There is something I own._

>**mi co'u ponse da**  
>_I lost all my property._

ponse
: x1 owns x2

co'u
: preposition: the event stops

This might look like a mind-breaking example. Here, a person was able to say "I own something." But then for every thing the person owned this situation ended.

Another example:

>**ro da vi fenki**  
>_Everyone is crazy here._  
>`Every one here crazy`

>**vi ku ro da fenki**  
>_Here everyone is crazy._  
>`Here: every one crazy`

Did you catch that?

1.  _Everyone is crazy here_ means that if someone is not crazy somewhere then they will become crazy in this place.
2.  _Here everyone is crazy_ simply describes those who are here (and they are crazy). We don't know anything about others in other places.

Another example with a noun started with a number:

>**pa prenu ro roi jundi**  
>_There is one person who is always attentive._  

\- it is the same person who is always attentive.

>**ro roi ku pa prenu cu jundi**  
>_Always there is one person who is always attentive._  

\- it is always that one person is attentive. People may change but there is one always attentive.

### Connecting sentences with prepositions

>**mi klama pa cmana ca lo nu pa mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_I am coming to a mountain while a cat is drinking milk._

>**mi klama pa cmana .i ca bo pa mlatu cu pinxe lo ladru**  
>_I am coming to a mountain, and at the same time a cat is drinking milk._

If two sentences are too long we can use **.i** to separate them. But we still can show that they express the same idea using prepositions. The second example differs from the first one in that it puts the assertion on both sentences.

So here we use **.i**, then the preposition that we need and then **bo**.

Usually we split sentences into two and then bind them with **bo** when a sentence looks or sounds too bulky.

But another use of this is to move prepositions out of scope of other prepositions:

>**mi na te vecnu ki'u lo nu kargu**  
>_It's not true that I buy because it's expensive._

So one might suppose that I only buy things if they are expensive. But no, I don't act thay way.

Here, **na** negates that _I buy things because they are expensive_. **na** is applied to the whole clause, thus it "covers" **ki'u**.

>**mi na te vecnu i ki'u bo kargu**  
>_I don't buy. It's because it's expensive._

Here, I don't buy things. Why? Because they are expensive. Maybe I prefer only cheap things.

Here, **ki'u** is placed to another sentence. Thus, **na** doesn't cover it.

Both sentences could be translated as _I don't buy because it's expensive._ However, they mean different things.

A special rule is for using **i ba bo** and **i pu bo**. Compare:

>**mi cadzu pu lo nu mi citka**  
>_I walk before I eat._

>**mi cadzu .i ba bo mi citka**  
>_I walk, and then I eat._

**.i ba bo** means _afterwards, then_. The sentence after **.i ba bo** refers to something that took place later than what took place in the sentence before.

**pu** is changed into **ba**, and vice versa. This special rule for Lojban was made by analogy of natural languages. So you just have to remember this special behavior of these two words.

### Existing things, "_there are ..._

There are actually three words in **da** series: **da**, **de**, **di**. We use them if you need to refer to different objects in one discourse:

>**ci mlatu cu citka re finpe**  
>**ci da poi mlatu cu citka re de poi finpe**  
>_There are three cats, there are two fishes for each cat, and each cat eats two fishes._  

If you need more such words in one discourse add a suffix **xi** to them and then any number (which we can call an index). Thus,

- **da xi pa** is the same as simple **da**,
- **da xi re** is the same as **de**,
- **da xi ci** is the same as **di**
- **da xi vo** is the fourth "something" and so on...

### Topic and comment. **zo'u**

Sometimes it is useful to show the topic of a clause and then say a comment about it:

>**lo finpe zo'u mi nelci lo salmone**  
>_As for fish I like salmon._

salmone
: ... is a salmon

zo'u
: ends the topic and starts the comment of the clause

**zo'u** is more useful when a pronoun like **da** is defined in the topic and then used in the comment:

>**da zo'u mi viska da**  
>_There is a thing such that I see it._

>**ro da poi gerku zo'u mi nelci da**  
>_For each thing that is a dog: I like it._  
>_I like all dogs._  

>**da de zo'u da viska de**  
>_There is **da** and **de** such that **da** sees **de**._  

The two pronouns **da** and **de** tell us that there are two things which stand in the relationship that one sees the other. It might be the case that the supposed two things are really just a single thing that loves itself: nothing in the sentence rules out that interpretation, which is why the colloquial translation does not say _Somebody sees somebody else._ The things referred to by different pronouns of **da** series may be different or the same.

It is perfectly okay for these pronouns to appear more than once in the main clause:

>**da zo'u da prami da**  
>_There is **da** such that **da** loves **da**.There is someone who loves himself/herself._  

It is not necessary for a pronoun to be the direct noun of the the main verb:

>**da zo'u lo gerku pe da cu viska mi**  
>_There is **da** such that the dog of them sees me.Somebody's dog sees me._  

### Scope in **da**

>**ci da poi mlatu cu citka re de poi finpe**  
>_There are three cats who eat two fishes each._  

By using **zo'u** we can make our sentence more clear:

>**ci da poi mlatu vau re de poi finpe zo'u da citka de**  
>_For three **da** which are cats, for two **de** which are fishes: **da** eats **de**._

Here we see that each of the cats is said to eat two fishes, and it might be different fishes each time; six fishes in total.

How then are we to express the other interpretation, in which just two men are involved? We cannot just reverse the order of variables in the prenex to

>**re de poi nanmu ci da poi gerku zo'u da batci de**  
>_For two **de** which are men, for three **da** which are dogs, **da** bites **de**_  

for although we have now limited the number of men to exactly two, we end up with an indeterminate number of dogs, from three to six. The distinction is called a “scope distinction”: in the first example **ci da poi gerku** is said to have wider scope than **re de poi nanmu**, and therefore precedes it in the prenex. In the second example the reverse is true.

To make to scope equal we use a special connective **ce'e** connecting two nouns.

>**ci da poi gerku ce'e re de poi nanmu cu batci**  
>**ci gerku re nanmu cu batci**  
>_Three dogs [plus] two men, bite._  

which picks out two groups, one of three dogs and the other of two men, and says that every one of the dogs bites each of the men. The second Lojban version uses forethought.

### "_any_" and "_some_" in examples

The words "any" and "some" and their derivatives have many meanings in English. We should be careful to translate that intended meaning:

- Simple specific _some_ is translated as **da**:

    >**da pu klama .i je ko smadi lo du'u da me ma kau**  
    >_Somebody came. Guess who it was._

    >**mi pu tirna da .i je mi fliba lo ka jimpe lo du'u da mo kau**  
    >_I heard something, but I fail to understand what it was._

- _some_ in questions turns into "anything", "anybody":

    >**xu da pu klama**  
    >_Did anybody come?_

- _any_ can be used in inner clauses:

    >**mi rivbi lo ka jdice da**  
    >_I avoided taking any decision._

    - like in clauses of prepositions:

        >**ba lo nu do zgana da vau ko klama**  
        >_After you notice anything, come!_

- Scope: _any_ is used in English when negating while Lojban uses **na** but then still **da**:

    >**mi na viska su'o da poi prenu**  
    >**mi na viska su'o prenu**  
    >_I don't see anybody._

- Scope: note that negation has to take appropriate clause like here:

      >**mi jinvi lo du'u na ku da jimpe**  
      >_I don't think that anybody understands._

      - This can be rephrased as:

          >**mi jinvi lo du'u no da jimpe**  
          >_I think that nobody understands._

- _every_ is turned into _any_ in comparisons and translated as **ro da**:

      >**do zmadu ro da lo ka clani**  
      >_You are taller than anybody._  
      >`You exceed everybody in tallness.`

- _any_ is used when providing choice and translated as **ro da**:

    >**ro da poi do nelci zo'u mi e'ande do lo ka citka da**  
    >_You may eat anything you like._  
    >`For everything that you like I allow you to eat it.`

    <dl><dt>permite</dt><dd>x1 allows x2 to do x3 (property of x2</dd></dl>

- _some_ is translated using **lo** when using commands, request, suggestions:

    >**e'u mi'o pilno lo drata**  
    >_Let's try other things._

    >**e'u mi'o troci bu'u lo drata**  
    >_Let's try somewhere else._

    - Compare it to:

        >**pa drata zo'u e'u mi'o pilno ri**  
        >_There is something else, let's use it._

        >**pa drata zo'u e'u mi'o troci bu'u ri**  
        >_There is another place, let's try there._

- _any_ is translated using **lo**

    - in generic statements:

        >**lo gerku cu se tuple vo da**  
        >_Any dog has four legs. Dogs have four legs._

    - and when making no distinction among members we talk about:

        >**mi na djica lo ka tavla lo na slabu be mi**  
        >_I don't want to talk to just anybody._

### "_anyone, any two ..._

>**e'u mi'o troci bu'u lo drata**  
>_Let's try somewhere else._

Here, **lo drata** actually means _any other thing or things, place or places_. The number of such places is not specified although any such place might fit.

What if we want to say "any place but only one place"? In this case we put a number after **lo**:

>**e'u mi'o troci bu'u lo pa drata**  
>_Let's try at another place._

Similarly,

>**e'u mi'o troci bu'u lo pa drata**  
>_Let's try at any two other places._

and so on.

Note that when a noun starts with **lo** it still has the notion of _any_. The difference can be important:

>**lo pa bangu no roi banzu**  
>_One language (any language) is never enough._

>**pa bangu no roi banzu**  
>_There is one language that is never enough._

Finally, nouns of existence imply _each_. There are two rings on the logo of Lojban. So

>**lo re djine cu sinxa la lojban**  
>_Two rings is a symbol of Lojban._

>**na ku re djine cu sinxa la lojban**  
>_It's not true that for two rings each of the rings is a symbol of Lojban._

djine
: x1 is a ring

### Resume: which constructs does scope affect?

Scope matters only for prepositions, **da**, **de**, **di** and nouns starting with numbers (like **pa prenu** - _one of the persons_). Thus the relative order of such constructs changes the meaning:

>**pa prenu ca ku zvati**  
>_There is one person who is now present._

>**ca ku pa prenu ca zvati**  
>_Now there is one person._

Scope isn't relevant for verbs and nouns starting with **lo** (like **lo prenu** or **lo re prenu**). Both these sentences mean the same:

>**lo prenu ca ku zvati**  
>**ca ku lo prenu cu zvati**  
>_People are now present._  

These two sentences also mean the same:

>**lo pa bangu no roi banzu**  
>**no roi ku lo pa bangu cu banzu**  
>_One language (any language) is never enough._

Scope ends in the end of the sentence. Here, **ki'u** is under the scope of **na**:

>**na ku mi te vecnu ki'u lo nu kargu**  
>_It's not true that: I buy because it's expensive._  

Here, **ki'u** is not under the scope of **na**. **ki'u** is applied to the whole previous sentence including **na**:

>**mi na te vecnu i ki'u bo kargu**  
>_I don't buy. It's because it's expensive._  

## Lesson 6. Prepositions: time and space

> **mi citka lo cirla**

Possible translations:

>_I eat cheese._  
>_I ate cheese._  
>_I always eat cheese._  
>_In a moment, I will have just finished eating cheese._  

Tenses in Lojban are optional, we don't have to think all the time what tense to use.

Context often resolves what is correct. We add tenses when we feel we need them.

Lojban tenses treat time and space the same. Saying that _I worked a long time ago_ is not grammatically different than saying _I work far away to the north_. English treats words like _earlier_, past tense ending _\-ed_ and space prepositions like _in_ or _near_ in three different schemes, while in Lojban they follow the same principle.

#### Points in time and place

Preposition without a noun after it describes the event as relative to _here_ and _now_:

>**mi pinxe ba**  
>_I will drink._

>**mi pinxe bu'u**  
>_I drink at this place._

Preposition with a noun after it describes the event as relative to the event in that noun:

>**mi pinxe ba lo nu mi cadzu**  
>_I drink after I walk._

#### Tenses: clauses inside clauses

In English we use the so called "sequence of tenses":

>**la alis pu cusku lo se du'u vo'a pu penmi la doris za lo djedi be li ci**  
>_Alice told that she had seen Doris three days before._

Here, the event "had seen Doris" happens before the event "Alice said". However, in

>**la alis pu cusku lo se du'u vo'a ca kansa la doris**  
>_Alice told that she was with Doris._

the two events (_told_ and _was with Doris_) happen at the same time.

Thus in English

- the tense of the main clause is understood relative to whoever utters those sentences.
- the tense of the clause inside the main clause is also understood relative to whoever utters those sentences.

And in Lojban

- only the tense of the main clause is relative to who utters those sentences.
- and other tenses are relative to each other. This is why, in the first example the second **pu** is relative to the first **pu**. In the second example, we use **ca** (_at the same time_) which is relative to the outer clause (**pu cusku** - _said_).

However, we can use the construct **ca ti** (_at this time or place_), which will give the same effect as how English works:

Here is an example in English style:

>**la alis pu cusku lo se du'u vo'a ca ti pu kansa la .doris.**  
>_Alis said that she was with Doris._

#### Distance in time and space

Prepositions

fau
: preposition. at the same time, place or situation as …

ca
: at … (some time), at the same time as …; <span style="">present tense</span>

bu'u
: at … (some place); here (at this place)

zi
: just (short time ago) <span style="">or</span> soon (in a short time)

vi
: near …

za
: a while ago <span style="">or</span> in a while, in an unspecified time

va
: not far from …

zu
: long time ago <span style="">or</span> in a long time

vu
: far away from …; far away

This is how we can use particles specifying how far we ago into the past or future:

- **pu zu** means _a long time ago_
- **pu za** means _a while ago_
- **pu zi** means _just_
- **ba zi** means _soon_
- **ba za** means _in a while_
- **ba zu** means _in a long time_

Notice the vowel order **i**, **a** and **u**. This order appears again and again in Lojban, and might be worth to memorize. _Short_ and _long_ in are always context dependent, relative and subjective. Two hundred years is a short time for a species to evolve, but a long time to wait for the bus.

**zi**, **za** and **zu** modify the previous preposition like **pu** and **ba**:

- **pu zu** is _a long time ago_. **pu** shows that we begin in the past, **zu** then that it is a long time backwards.
- **zu pu** is _far away in time there is a point after some event_. **zu** shows that we begin at some point far away in time from now, **pu** then, that we move backwards from that point.

Thus **pu zu** is always in the past. **zu pu** could be in the future.

Spatial distance is marked in a similar way by **vi**, **va** and **vu** for short, unspecified (medium) and long distance in space.

We can use them as prepositions as well:

>**ba za lo djedi be li ci mi zvati ti**  
>_In three days I will be here._

The space equivalent of **ca** is **bu'u**. And **fau** is more vague than two of them, it can mean time, space or situation.

>**ba za vu ku mi gunka**  
>_Some time in the future, I will work a place long away._

gunka
: to work

>**mi bu'u pu zu gunka**  
>_I used to work here a long time ago._  
>`I here-past-long-time-distance work`

>**pu zu vu ku zasti fa lo ninmu .e lo nanmu**  
>_Long ago and far away lived a woman and a man._

The last sentence is how fairy tales often begin.

#### Duration in time and space

Prepositions

ze'i
: for a short time

ve'i
: over a small space

ze'a
: for some time

ve'a
: over some space

ze'u
: for a long time

ve'u
: over the long space

Again it's easy to remember given the pattern **i**, **a**, **u**.

>**mi ze'u bajra**  
>_I run for a long time._

>**la .bob. ze'u pinxe lo birje**  
>_Bob drinks beer for a long time._

>**mi bazize'a xabju la .djakartas.**  
>_Pretty soon I'm going to live in Jakarta for a while._

>**lo jenmi pe la .romas. ba ze'u gunta la .kart.xadact.**  
>_The army of Romans will be attacking Carthage for a long time._

This does not mean that Romans are not attacking Carthage these days. In Lojban, if we say that something is true at a particular time, it doesn't mean that it is not true at any other time. You can say **pu ba ze'u** so that we know that this activity was in future when viewed from some point in past but in past when viewed from today.

>**lo ve'u xamsi**  
>_ocean_

>**lo xamsi**  
>_sea/ocean_

>**lo ve'u cmana**  
>_hill_

>**lo cmana**  
>_mountain/hill_

>**do ve'u klama lo dotco gugde ze'u**  
>_You spend a long time traveling a long space to Germany._

>**ti ve'u gerku**  
>_That's a big dog. This is a dog covering a large space._

#### Event contours

Here are several sets of prepositions that can help us add finer meanings when necessary.

With the _event contours_ and unlike **pu**, **ca** and **ba** we view each event as having shape with certain stages:

##### **pu'o** - _to be about_, **ba'o** - _no longer_

>**mi ba tavla lo mikce**  
>_I will speak to the doctor (and I might be speaking now too)._

>**mi pu pu'o tavla lo mikce**  
>_I was about to speak to the doctor (I was not speaking at that time, the event hadn't started by that time)._

pu'o
: preposition: to be about to do something (the event has not yet happened)

ba'o
: preposition: to be no longer doing something, to have done something (the event has ended)

Other examples:

>**lo sanmi ca pu'o bredi**  
>_The meal is not ready yet._

>**mi pu ba'o tavla lo mikce**  
>_I had spoken to the doctor._

>**mi ba ba'o tavla lo mikce**  
>_I will have spoken to the doctor._

>**.a'o mi ba zi ba'o gunka**  
>_I hope soon I will have done the work._

##### **za'o** - _still_, **xa'o** - _already_

>**ri'a ma do za'o zvati vi**  
>_Why are you still here?_

>**la .kevin. xa'o zvati vi**  
>_Kevin is already here._

za'o
: still. The event is in process beyond its natural end

xa'o
: already, too early. The event already started and it is too early

##### Stages of event

>**mi co'a tavla**  
>_I started talking._

>**le fetsi ca'o ciska**  
>_She keeps writing._

>**le nakni pu co'u vasxu**  
>_He stopped breathing (sudden unpredictable change)._

vasxu
: x1 breathes x2

>**mi pu mo'u citka le plise**  
>_I've eaten the apple up._

>**la .maks. pu mo'u zbasu lo vi dinju**  
>_Max has built this house._

>**le fetsi pu de'a vasxu**  
>_She ceased to breath (but may breath again later)._

>**mi pu di'a citka lo plise**  
>_I resumed eating apples._

co'a
: preposition: the event starts (the border of the event)

ca'o
: preposition: to be doing something (the event is in progress)

co'u
: preposition: the event stops

mo'u
: preposition: the event ends (the border of the event)

de'a
: the event pauses (the event can be expected to continue)

di'a
: the event resumes

de'a ze'i jundi
: BRB (I'll be right back)

mi di'a jundi
: I am back (being attentive)

jundi
: x1 pays attention to x2

These two expressions are common in text chats for saying that you stop paying attention or away, and then back online:

One could of course also say just **de'a** or **di'a** and hope the point gets across.

##### Continuous and Progressive

ru'i
: preposition: the event is continuous

>**.i mi pu ru'i citka lo mango**  
>_I was eating apples one and on without stop._

Note the difference:

- **ru'i** says that the event is continuous and never pauses.
- **ca'o** says that the event progresses. It may sometimes pause and then resume its progress.

#### Place contours

Event contours can be used to refer to space if we prefix them with **fe'e**:

>**lo rokci cu kuspe fe'e co'u lo canko**  
>_The rock reached and stopped by the window._

kuspe
: x1 extends, reaches across scope, range x2

#### Space: "_to the left_", "_to the right_"

>**lo prenu cu sanli lo dertu bu'u lo pritu be mi**  
>_The person stands on the ground to the right of me._

>**lo gerku cu vreta lo ckana bu'u lo zunle be lo verba**  
>_A dog is lying on the bed to the left of a child._

>**ko jgari le panbi poi zunle**  
>_Take the pen on the left._

>**pa mlatu cu plipe bu'u lo crane be do**  
>_A cat jumps in front of you._

>**ko catlu lo dinju poi crane**  
>_Look at the house in the front._

>**lo verba cu zutse lo stizu bu'u lo trixe be mi**  
>_The child sits on the chair behind me._

zunle
: x1 is to the left of x2

pritu
: x1 is to the right of x2

crane
: x1 is in front of x2 (x1 is between x2 and whoever watches)

trixe
: x1 is behind x2

sanli
: x1 stands on x2

zutse
: x1 sits on x2

vreta
: x1 lies on x2

lo dertu
: ground, dirt

lo ckana
: bed

lo stizu
: chair

To specify the reference point we additionally use the preposition **ki**. This is important when speaking about left and right:

>**lo prenu cu sanli ki mi bu'u lo pritu be lo tricu**  
>_The person stands to the right of a tree from my viewpoint._

>**lo dinju cu zunle lo rokci ki ti**  
>_The house is to the left of the rock if viewed from here._

As you can see

- to get the name for a vowel, we add "bu"
- to get the name for a consonant, we add "y"
- the word for **'** (apostrophe) is **.y'y**.

We can spell word using these names. For example, CNN will be **cy. ny. ny.**

A capital letter alone has a special meaning. It denotes the name of that letter:

**A** is the same as **.abu**, **B** is the same as **by.** and so on. They means the same and even are read the same as normal **.abu**, **by.** etc. So _CNN_ can also be written as **CNN** in Lojban and it will be still pronounced and mean the same as **cy. ny. ny.**

### Letters instead of "_he_" and "_she_"

Names of letters are pronouns. And we can use them for another method of referring to nouns and names earlier used in speech.

>**la lukas cu viska lo mlatu i lo mlatu cu na viska la lukas**  
>**la lukas cu viska lo mlatu i my. na viska ly.**  
>_Lucas sees a cat. The cat doesn't see Lucas._

As the first letter in **lukas** is **l** and the first letter in **mlatu** is **m** we can use names of letters to refer to nouns that we get from them. Both Lojban sentences mean the same.

So if you see a Lojban letter being used as a noun, you take it as referring to the last noun or name whose verb word (**lukas** and **mlatu** in this case) starts with that letter.

Clearly, this method is more powerful than _he_ or _she_. It also allows us to make the speech more concise in not forcing us to repeat possible long names or nouns over and over again.

But notice that it can happen that we'd like to refer back to, say, **lo mlatu**, but then before we can do so, another noun or name that starts with **m** appeared in the meantime, so that **my.** can no longer refer to the cat. The quickest way out is to repeat the entire noun or name, i.e. say **le mlatu**:

>**lo mlatu cu viska la .micel. i my. na viska le mlatu**  
>_A cat sees Michelle. Michelle doesn't see the cat._

If a name consists of several cmevla you can use the first letters of them to refer to that name. The same is for compound verbs:

>**la .djon.smit. cu citka lo finpe stasu i dy.sy. nelci fy.sy.**  
>_John Smith is eating fish soup. He likes it._

If you need to put several pronouns one after another separate them with the particle **boi**:

>**mi klama la paris la moskov**  
>_I go to Paris from Moscow._

>**mi klama py. boi my.**  
>_I go to P from M._

The phrase **mi klama py. my.** would mean _I go to PM_ which wouldn't mean what is needed here.

>**la .tom.silver. pu zvati i je'u ty. sy. boi .ui pu sidju mi**  
>_Tom Silver was present. And actually TS (yay!) helped me._

If you put an interjection after such letters separate them with **boi**. Without **boi** interjections will refer to the last letter.

### **ri** instead of "_he_" and "_she_"

>**mi catlu pa nanmu i ri melbi**  
>_I look at a man. He is handsome._

<figure>
  <img src="https://mw.lojban.org/images/thumb/7/71/Gael_garcia_bernal.jpg/96px-Gael_garcia_bernal.jpg" alt="lo melbi">
  <figcaption>
  <b>lo melbi</b><br/>
  <i>beautiful, handsome, pretty</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="https://mw.lojban.org/images/thumb/3/3f/Lindo_Sol_em_Plataforma.jpg/96px-Lindo_Sol_em_Plataforma.jpg" alt="lo se pluka">
  <figcaption>
  <b>lo se pluka</b><br/>
  <i>nice, pleasant</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

The particle **ri** refers to the last completed noun used in text or someone's speech.

**melbi** means both _handsome_ and _beautiful_ no matter the person of what gender you describe.

Another example:

>**la .alis. cu sipna bu'u lo kumfa pe la .alis.**  
>_Alice sleeps in Alice's room._  
>`Alice sleeps-in the of-Alice room.`

is turned into:

>**la .alis. cu sipna bu'u lo kumfa pe ri**  
>_Alice sleeps in her room._  
>`Alice sleeps in the room of \[last noun\].`

The **ri** is equivalent to repeating the last noun or name, which is **la .alis.** here.

Note that **ri** refers to completed nouns. **ri** does not repeat **lo kumfa pe ri** (which is also a noun), because **ri** is inside that noun and therefore that noun is not yet complete when **ri** appears. This prevents **ri** from making it recursively refer to itself.

Nouns are counted from their beginnings. So in an example like

>**lo du'u lo nanmu cu melbi cu se djuno ri**  

the **ri** refers to **lo nanmu** and not **lo du'u lo nanmu cu melbi** although bot nouns are complete: **lo nanmu** starts last, after the start of **lo du'u lo nanmu cu melbi**.

Clause inside **sei** forms a parallel text. **ri** ignores nouns inside **sei**\-clauses:

>**mi viska la .lukas. sei la .doris. pu cusku i ri jibni la .micel.**  
>_I see Lucas, — Doris said. He is near Michelle._

In this example **ri** cannot refer to **la .doris.** We simply ignore the whole **sei la .doris. pu cusku** clause when deciding what **ri** should refer to.

Also note that most pronouns are ignored by **ri**. We just repeat them directly:

>**mi lumci mi**  
>_I wash me.I wash myself._

lumci
: x1 washes x2 of contaminant x3

>**mi prami mi**  
>_I love me.I love myself._

However,

1.  the particles **ti**, **ta**, **tu** are picked up by **ri**, because you might have changed what you are pointing at, so repeating **tu** may not be effective.
2.  likewise, **ri** itself (or rather it's antecedent) can be repeated by a later **ri**; in fact, a string of **ri** particles with no other intervening nouns always repeat the same noun:

>**.i la .alis. cu catlu pa nanmu .i ri melbi .i ri co'a zgana a bu**  
>_Alice notices a man. He is beautiful. He notices Alice._

zgana
: to observe

co'a zgana
: to start observing, to notice

Here the second **ri** has as antecedent the first **ri**, which has as antecedent **lo nanmu**. All three refer to the same thing: the man.

Only you decide what, where and when to use in speech: the method with **le**+verb words, the method with letter names or with **ri**.

### "_Myself, themselves_"

In Slavic languages people say literally _I wash self_. In order to be closer to a Slavic style we can use **lo nei**.

>**mi nelci mi**  
>_I like myself._  
>`I like me.`

It is the same in meaning as:

>**mi nelci lo nei**  
>_I like myself._

>**mi lumci mi**  
>**mi lumci lo nei**  
>_I wash myself._

>**la ian ca lumci lo nei**  
>**la ian ca lumci ri**  
>_Yan washes himself._

**lo nei** links to the first noun of the current clause.

Remember that **ri** can't refer back to pronouns like **mi** so **lo nei** might be preferred in the last example. When changing the first noun **lo nei** doesn't change which is quite handy:

>**mi lumci lo nei i do lumci lo nei i la ian cu lumci lo nei**  
>_I wash myself. You wash yourself. Yan washes himself._

>**la .doris. cu pensi lo nei**  
>_Doris thinks about herself._

>**pa gerku cu batci lo nei**  
>_A dog bites itself._

---

**nei** works well when a sentence only contains one clause. But when it has several embedded clauses we might need something different. In

>**la .doris. cu djuno lo du'u la .alis. cu prami lo nei**  
>_Doris knows that Alice loves herself._

**lo nei** refers to **la .alis.**

What if we want to refer to Doris? Here is a solution:

>**la .doris. cu djuno lo du'u la .alis. cu prami vo'a**  
>_Doris knows that Alice loves her._

So while **lo nei** refers to the first noun of the current clause, **vo'a** refers to the first noun of the current sentence.

When there are no embedded clauses those two words mean the same:

>**la .alis. cu prami vo'a** is the same as **la .alis. cu prami lo nei**  
>_Alice loves herself._

- **vo'a** refers to the first noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'e** refers to the second noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'i** refers to the third noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'o** refers to the 4th noun of the current sentence.
- **vo'u** refers to the 5th noun of the current sentence.

---

**lo nei** can give funny results when applied to mutual actions:

>**la alis e la kevin cu cinba lo nei**  
>_Alice kisses herself, and Kevin kisses himself._

Here is the solution:

>**la alis jo'u la kevin cu cinba zu'ai**  
>_Alice and Kevin kiss each other_

It means the same as:

>**la alis cu cinba la kevin i je la kevin cu cinba la alis**  
>_Alice kisses Kevin, and Kevin kisses Alice._

**zu'ai** is put into the second place of the verb. It shows the mutual action between the first place and the second place. Members of this mutual action are put to the first and connected with the conjunction **jo'u**.

### **go'i** for the previous clause

>**la .alis. cu klama lo barja .i la .alis. cu viska lo nanmu**

is the same in meaning as:

>**la .alis. cu klama lo barja .i lo go'i cu viska lo nanmu**  
>_Alice comes to a bar. She sees a man._

Whereas **lo nei** refers to the first noun of the current clause, **lo go'i** refers to the first noun of the previous clause.

**go'i** presents yet another way of referring back to a noun that we need.

- **lo se go'i** refers to the second noun of the previous clause
- **lo te go'i** to the third etc.:

>**.i la .alis. cu zgana lo nanmu .i ri melbi**  
>_Alice watches a man. He is handsome._

is the same as

>**.i la .alis. cu zgana lo nanmu .i lo se go'i cu melbi**  
>_Alice watches a man. He is handsome._

That's because **lo se go'i** refers to the second place (x2) of the preceding clause, which is **lo nanmu**.

Consider another example:

>_Bill saw Bob. He hit him._

English doesn't bother with precision here — _he_ just means "_some male person mentioned earlier._" Did Bill hit Bob, or did Bob hit Bill? We don't know. In Lojban we can use say like this:

>**la bil pu viska la bob i lo se go'i cu darxi lo go'i**  
>_Bill saw Bob. Bob hit Bill._

Although, in most cases **ri** is used:

>**la bil cu viska la bob i ri darxi la bil**  
>_Bill saw Bob. Bob hit Bill._

**go'i** itself is a verb, and it thus has a place structure:

>**mi tatpi i do ji'a go'i**  
>_I'm tired. And you too._

When we say **do go'i**, we repeat the previous clause but replace its first place with **do**. In other words, **do ji'a go'i** here is the same as saying **do ji'a tatpi**.

### What does **go'i** copy?

Interjections like **pei** (when used alone), **xu**, **.ui**, **.u'i**, **je'u** those formed with **sei** and the question interjection are not parts of clauses. Thus they are not copied by **go'i**.

But prepositions like **na**, **pu**, left negators like **na'e**, **no'e**, **to'e** are parts of clauses.

Thus, **go'i** copies the previous clause with those particles:

>**— la bob na prami la alis**  
>_— **go'i**_
>_— It is not true that Bob loves Alice._  
>_—  He doesn't (love)._  

>**— la bob na'e prami la alis**  
>**— go'i**  
>_— Bob doesn't love Alice._  
>_— He doesn't (love)._  

In order to say "No, he does love her" we use the needed verb directly:

>**la bob na prami la alis**  
>**la bob ja'a prami la alis**  
>_Bob doesn't love Alice._  
>_Bob does love Alice._  

### Time of day, dates and calendar

#### Time of day

— **ma tcika ti** = _What's the time?_  
— **li cy pa pa** = _Eleven hours_

tcika
: x1 (hours, minutes, seconds) is the time of event x2

In Lojban times are always the times of something. So we ask what the time is of **ti**, meaning _this event/thing_, or, in other words _now_.

- **cy** is a prefix signalling that the number of hours follows. 24-hour time is used almost always in Lojban.
- **my** is a prefix signalling that the number of minutes follows.
- **sy** is a prefix signalling that the number of seconds follows.

>**li cy pa pa my pa no**  
>_11:10 (Ten minutes past eleven)_

>**li cy pa pa my pa no sy pa ci**  
>_11 hours, 10 minutes and 13 seconds._

>**li cy pa no my mu no**  
>_10:50, ten to eleven_

If we want to give the time of an event, rather than just tell the time, the second place is filled:

>**li cy pa no tcika lo nu mi klama**  
>_Ten o'clock is the time that I come._

By using the preposition **de'i** we can get a more naturally sounding sentence:

>**mi klama de'i li cy pa no**  
>_I am going at 10 o'clock._

de'i
: at ... (time), on ... (date)

And one useful example:

>**ca tcika lo nu ei sipna**  
>_It's time to sleep._

#### Dates

— **ma detri ti** = _What's the date today?_  
— **li ly ze dy pa** = _It's July, 1_

detri
: x1 (year, month, day) is the date/time of event x2

Another option:

— **ma ca detri**  
— _What is the date now?_

- **ny** is a prefix signalling that the year follows.
- **ly** is a prefix signalling that the month follows.
- **jy dy** is a prefix signalling that the day of week follows.
- **dy** is a prefix signalling that the day follows.

Prefixes with numbers after them can be used in any order (let's use digits to show numbers):

>**li dy 2 ca detri**  
>_It's the second day of the month now._

>**li ly 4 dy 1 ca detri**  
>_It's April, the first now._

>**li dy 5 ly 7 ny 2005 detri lo nu mi jbena**  
>_The fifth of July (seventh month), year 2005 is when I was born._

We can also use **de'i**:

>**mi ba klama de'i li ly pano**  
>_I will come in October._

Remember that particles in Lojban can be written without spaces in between like in this **pano**, which is the same as **pa no**.

For days of week Monday is the first day:

>**mi gunka de'i li jy dy pa**  
>_I work on Monday._

>**mi gunka de'i ro li jy dy mu**  
>_I work every Tuesday._

>**xu do pu zvati la paris de'i li jy dy ci**  
>_Were you in Paris on Wednesday?_

#### Specifying time intervals

>**mi nanca li re re**  
>_I am 22 years old._

nanca
: x1 is of duration of x2 (number) years

**nanca** specifies the duration, and in order too say _two years long_ you fill the second place with a number prefixed with **li**.

>**lo verba cu masti li re**  
>_The child is two months old._

masti
: x1 is x2 months long

>**lo nu carvi cu djedi li ci**  
>_It's raining for three days._

djedi
: x1 is x2 full days long

### New verbs from one scale

>**mi na'e nelci do**  
>_I other than like you._  

"Left scalar" particles (to which **na'e** belongs) are put to the left of constructs they affect and form a scale:

- **je'a** = _indeed (the affirmative position on the scale)_. The word **je'a** confirms the meaning of a part of sentence. Usually it's just omitted.

    >**mi je'a nelci do**  
    >_I indeed like you._

- **na'e** = _non- (other than the affirmative position on the scale)_

    >**mi na'e nelci do**
    >_I other than like you._

- **no'e** = _not really (midpoint on the scale)_. The word **no'e** makes a part of sentence middle in its meaning.

      >**mi no'e nelci do**  
      >_As for whether I love or hate you, I'm indifferent to you. I neither like nor hate you._

- **to'e** = _anti-, dis-, mis- etc. (opposite on the scale)_. The word **to'e** makes a part of sentence opposite in its meaning. It's similar to English _anti-_.

      >**mi to'e nelci do**  
      >_I hate you._    
      >`I anti-like you`

**na'e** is more vague than **no'e** and **to'e**, it can mean any of them when you don't care about the exact meaning.

## Lesson 8. Math and more prepositions

### _Possibly can_, _have been_ and _haven't yet been_

>**lo cipni ka'e vofli**  
>_Birds can fly._

>**lo pendo be mi ca'a xendo prenu**  
>_My friend shows himself as a friendly person._

>**lo pendo be mi ka'e litru bu'u ro da**  
>_A friend of mine can travel in any place._

>**mi ca'a zvati la madrid**  
>_I am in Madrid._

>**mi pu'i zvati la madrid**  
>_I have been to Madrid._

>**mi nu'o zvati la madrid**  
>_I have never been to Madrid._

ka'e
: preposition of potential: possibly can

ca'a
: preposition of potential: actually is

pu'i
: preposition of potential: has already happened

nu'o
: preposition of potential: hasn't ever happened

This series of so called prepositions of potential describes possible situations.

Note that **ka'e** means that an event can happen whereas, for example,

>**lo cipni cu kakne lo ka vofli**  
>_Birds are capable of flying._

describes abilities dependent on actions of participants.

### _Plus_ and _minus_

>**li mu du li re su'i ci**  
>_Five equals two plus three._

Here **li** is similar to **lo** but it starts a mathematical expression (or just a number). So **li mu** means _Number 5_ for use in formulae unlike simple **mu** which is used to denote 5 objects or events.

Note that **re su'i ci** (_2+3_) is one single expression considered as one noun.

**du** is a verb and means _to be equal to_.

- **su'i** means _plus_.
- **vu'u** means _minus_.
- **pi'i** means _times_ and is used for multiplication
- **fe'i** means _divided by_ and is used for division.

The word **pi** is a decimal separator so **no pi mu** means _0.5_, **ci ze pi pa so** means _37.19_.

In some notations 0.35 can be written as .35 and in Lojban we can also drop zero saying **pi mu**.

Here are some other examples.

li pare fe'i ci du li vo
: 12 : 3 = 4

li re pi'i re du li vo
: two times two is four

li pano vu'u mu pi'i re du li no
: 10 — 5 ⋅ 2 = 0

Notice that you put **li** only once before the equation and once after it. Thus _12 : 3_ is considered one number. Indeed, _4_ is the same as _12 : 3_. They are both numbers.

For asking for a number we use **ma**:

>**li ci su'i vo du ma**  
>_3 + 4 = ?_

>**li ze**  
>_7_

### "_First, second, last_"

Ordinal numbers such as "first, second, third" are used to put things in order. In Lojban they are formed with a number plus **moi** immediately after it:

pa moi
: x1 is first among ...

re moi
: x1 is second among ...

ci moi
: x1 is third among ...

…

ro moi
: x1 is last among ...

It is also possible to use verbs instead of numbers:

me mi moi
: x1 is mine

me do moi
: x1 is yours

In this case we had to convert pronouns to verbs using **me**.

>**le nakni cu pa moi lo se prami be mi**  
>_He is my first love._

>**tu ro moi lo ratcu pe mi**  
>_That is my last rat._

>**lo cerni tarci cu ro moi lo tarci poi cumki fa lo nu viska ke'a pu lo nu co'a donri**  
>_The morning star is the last star that's visible before the dawning of the day._

>**tu me mi moi**  
>_That's mine._

>**tu me mi moi lo stizu**  
>_That's my place._

>**.i lo vi stizu cu me mi moi lo pa ci stizu poi sruri lo jubme**  
>_This place is mine among 13 places around the table._

Cardinal numbers are placed before ordinal numbers in a string and separated by **boi**:

>**lo ci boi pa moi be lo ckafi kabri**  
>_the first three cups of coffee_

Without **boi** it would turn into **ci pa moi** – _thirty-first_.

### **gau** - make them do it

The preposition **gau** marks the agent of event:

>**le canko cu kalri**  
>_The window is open._

>**le canko gau do kalri**  
>_You open the window._  
>`The window driven-by you is open`

gau
: preposition: caused by ... (agent), driven by ... (someone, some object)

kalri
: x1 is open

Thus, such verbs as _to open (something)_, _to move_ can be rephrased as _to make something open_, _to make something move_ and therefore we don't need to learn extra verbs for every such meaning. Instead we add the preposition **gau** all the time.

There is also another method that retains the same order of words as in English:

**le canko gau ko kalri  
ko jai gau kalri fai le canko**  
_Open the window!_

Here we transform the verb **kalri** - _to be open_ into a verb

jai gau kalri
: to open something

The first place of **kalri** can be shown by using a place tag **fai**.

Some more variations:

>**le pa karce cu muvdu**  
>_The car moves._

**ko jai gau muvdu fai le karce  
le karce gau ko muvdu**  
_Move the car! Make the car move!_

>**fa le karce cu muvdu fe ti**  
>_The car moves here._

>**ko jai gau muvdu fai le karce fe ti**  
>_Move the car here!_

**muvdu** - _is moving_ is transformed into a new verb **jai gau muvdu** - _to move_.

muvdu
: x1 moves to x2 from x3 via x4

jai gau muvdu fai le karce
: x1 moves the car to x2 from x3 via x4

>**la alis cu klama**  
>_Alice comes._

>**la alis gau ko klama**  
>_Make Alice come!_

### _Why_? - **ri'a** and **ni'i**

>**- ri'a ma carvi**  
>**- lo nu lo dilnu cu klaku**  
>_- Why is it raining?_  
>_- Because the clouds are crying._  

ri'a
: because of ... (some event)

ri'a ma
: why?

Unlike **gau** the preposition **ri'a** expects not an agent, but an event like _the clouds are crying_:

>**lo dilnu cu klaku ri'a lo nu lo dargu cu cilmo**  
>_Skies are crying resulting in the road being wet._

_Therefore_ is the reverse word compared to _because_:

>**lo dilnu cu klaku i se ri'a bo lo dargu cu cilmo**  
>_Skies are crying. Therefore the road is wet._

ri'a
:because

se ri'a
: therefore

Another type of _why_ is **ni'i**:

>**- ni'i ma nicte**  
>**- lo nu lo solri na te gusni**  
>_- Why is it night?_  
>_- Because the sun is not shining._  

>**lo solri na te gusni i se ni'i bo nicte**  
>_The sun is not shining. Therefore, it's night._  

ni'i
: logically because of ...

seni'i
: with the logical consequence that ..., logically therefore

Here we can't use **ri'a** as we are talking not about a result but about logical implication. The fact that it is night just logically follows from the sun not shining.

#### Prepositions more precise than **ri'a**

>**mi darxi la .kevin. mu'i lo nu ky. lacpu lo kerfa be mi**  
>_I hit Kevin because he pulled my hair._

mu'i
: because (of motive …)

In this example, what we have is not two events which are physically connected, like clouds and rain, but three events:

1.  Kevin pulls my hair.
2.  I decide, as a result of this, to hit Kevin.
3.  I hit Kevin.

English misses out the second event and says _Sally hit Joey because he pulled her hair._ However, this is not only vague but, some would say, psychologically dangerous. People do not generally react to stimuli automatically, but as a result of motivation, and confusing complex responses with simple physical causation may lead us to believe that we have no control over our emotions or even our actions. Thus, it is often useful to say not just general reactions (**ri'a**) but emphasize responses which have a cognitive/emotional element (**mu'i**).

> **la .salis. cu te dunda lo tartcita lo ctuca ki'u lo nu sy. carmi gunka**

ki'u
: because (due to explanation …)

The difference between motivation and justification is not always clear, but we can say that the latter involves some rule or standard while the former does not require this. Going back to the example of Sally and the teacher, it is possible to say

>**la .salis. cu te dunda lo tartcita lo ctuca mu'i lo nu sy. carmi gunka**  
>`Sally is-given a star-label \[by\] the teacher with-motivation she much-try work.`

However, this says only that Sally's hard work motivated the teacher to give her a star. It does not imply that it is the custom for teachers to give stars (or ‘star-labels’, as I have rather pedantically translated it) as a reward for good work. What we need here is **ki'u**, the preposition from **krinu**.

Note: Don't get **ki'u** mixed up with **ku'i** which means _but, however_.

**ki'u** appeals to more general considerations than **mu'i**, but it still deals with human standards, not logical laws. Only a very naive student would believe that if a student is given a star, it must logically imply that that student has worked hard.

In the case **ni'i ma nicte**, however, the fact that the Sun isn't shining it is night logically entails that the Sun isn't shining. Here we can confidently use **nibli** or **ni'i**.

### "_So … that_"

The expression _so ... that_ is expressed in Lojban by splitting the sentence into two:

>**mi tai galtu plipe .i se ri'a bo mi farlu**  
>_I jumped so high that I fell down._

tai
: preposition: in the manner of ...

Other examples:

>**mi tai zukte**  
>_I act this way_

>**mi tai fengu**  
>_I am so angry._

fengu
: x1 is angry of x2 (clause)

### "_If … then_"

>**fau lo nu do fenki vau mi ba prami do**  
>_If you are crazy then I'll love you._

fau
: preposition: with the event of ..., under circumstances ... (clause follows)

**fau** is much like **ca** (_when_) or **bu'u** (_at (some place)_).

In many cases we can replace **fau** with **ca** getting almost the same meaning (sometimes more precise):

>**mi ba prami do ca lo nu do fenki**  
>_I'll love you when you are crazy._

We can replace **lo** with **ro** after such prepositions getting a new meaning:

>**mi ba prami do ca ro nu do fenki**  
>_I'll love you whenever you are crazy._

#### **fau** and **da'i**. _What if ..._

>**da'i mi turni**  
>_I could be a king._

>**da'i nai mi turni**  
>_I am a king._

- The interjection **da'i** marks the clause in which it is put as describing an imaginary event.
- The opposite interjection **da'inai** marks the clause as describing an actual, real event.

Constructs with **da'i** are usually translated to English with so called auxiliary verbs such as _can/could, will/would, may/might, should_ and _must_. Clauses with **da'i** in English are said to be in _subjunctive mood_.

Omitting **da'i** or **da'inai** makes the sentence clear only from context which is usually quite transparent. That's why **da'i** or **da'inai** is not obligatory. We use it for clarity when needed.

Clauses with **da'i** often include **fau**:

>**da'i mi gleki fau lo nu mi ponse lo megdo be lo rupnu**  
>_I would/could be happy if I had one million dollars._

fau
: in the event/situation/world of …

megdo
: x1 is a million of x2

Here the event inside **fau** is equally imagined together with **mi gleki**. And here is the reverse example:

>**da'inai mi gleki fau lo nu mi ponse lo megdo be lo rupnu**  
>_Having one million dollars I am happy._

A good example of **mo** and **da'i**:

>**mo da'i fau lo nu mi cusku zo nai**  
>_What if I say "no"?_

#### Probabilities

Suppose you come home and hear someone scratching. You can say one of the following sentences:

>**fau da ti mlatu.**  
>_This might be/possibly is a cat. It is possible that this is a cat._  
>(You keep several animals at home. So it might be your cat scratching but you are not sure.)

>**fau ro da ti mlatu.**  
>_this must be/certainly is the cat._    
>(You have a cat and such noise can be produced by only one object, that cat.)

>**fau so'e da ti mlatu.**  
>_This should be/probably is the cat._  
>(If you have a dog then it can also produce such sounds but your dog usually doesn't do that so the cat is more likely.)

>**fau so'u da ti mlatu.**  
>_It is not probable that this is the cat._  

>**fau no da ti mlatu**  
>_This can't be the cat. This mustn't be the cat. It is impossible that this is the cat._

Notice that we omitted **da'i** for brevity. But if we want to be explicitly clear about the events being imaginary **da'i** in these examples is to be put inside the **fau** clause:

1.  **fau da'i da** denotes that the event in this clause _is possible, may/can possibly happen._
2.  **fau da'i ro da** — the event _would necessarily happen._
3.  **fau da'i so'e da** — the event _is probable, will probably happen, is likely to happen._
4.  **fau da'i so'o da** — the event _is remotely probable, could/might happen._
5.  **fau da'i so'u da** — the event _is not likely, probably don't happen._
6.  **fau da'i no da** — the event _is not possible._

The difference between these is in the number of imaginary situations we take into account. We don't describe those situations, we just mark them as **da** (_something_) letting the context (or our listeners) decide what those situations are.

#### Words with possibility implied in their places

Some verbs have **da'i** implied in some of their places when you don't use **da'i** explicitly:

>**mi pacna lo nu do ba pluka sipna**  
>_I hope you will have a pleasant sleep._

pacna
: x1 hopes for x2 (possible event) with likelihood x3 (number, by default **li so'a** i.e. close to 1)

>**mi kanpe lo nu do tsuku**  
>_I expect you to arrive._

>**mi kanpe lo nu do ba jinga vau li so'e**  
>_You'll probably win._  
>`I expect with a high probability that you will win.`

>**mi kanpe lo nu mi cortu fau ro nu lo rokci cu farlu lo tuple be mi**  
>_I know for a fact that if a rock lands on my foot, it will hurt._

kanpe
: x1 expects x2 (possible event) with expected likelihood x3 (a number from 0 till 1, the default value is **li so'a**, i.e. near 1)

Unlike **pacna** the verb **kanpe** doesn't necessarily implies hope or wish. It can describe impartial expectation, subjective evaluation of the probability of a situation.

>**cumki fa lo nu do jinga**  
>_It is possible that you win._

>**- xu ba carvi**  
>**- cumki**  
>_- Will it rain?_  
>_- Maybe._  

cumki
: x1 (possible event) is possible, x1 may, might occur, x1 is a maybe.

>**- xu ba carvi**  
>**- lakne**  
>_- Will it rain?_  
>_- Probably._  

lakne
: x1 (possible event) is probable, likely

>**mi djica lo nu do jinga**  
>_I want you to win._

>**mi djica lo ka vitke fi la .paris.**  
>_I would rather visit Paris. I want to visit Paris._

djica
: x1 wants x2 (possible event)

>**mi te mukti lo ka vitke fi la .paris.**  
>_I will visit Paris. I intend to/I'm gonna visit Paris._

>**mi te mukti vitke fi la .paris.**  
>_I'm visiting Paris intentionally._

te mukti
: x1 is motivated to bring about goal x2 (possible event) by motive x3 (event)

>**mi kakne lo ka limna**  
>_I am able to swim._

>**mi pu kakne lo ka gunka**  
>_I could work. I was able to work._

kakne
: x1 can, is able to do x2 (property of x1)

x2 describes a possible event.

>**mi te javni lo ka gunka**  
>_I should work._

te javni
: x1 should/ought to do x2 (property of x1) under rule x3 (proposition)

x2 describes a possible event.

>**do na te javni lo ka tcidu**  
>_You don't have to read._

na te javni
: x1 doesn't have to, needn't to do x2 (property of x1) under rule x3 (proposition)

x2 describes a possible event.

>**mi nitcu lo ka sipna**  
>_I need to sleep._

nitcu
: x1 needs x2 (possible event)

>**mi bilga lo ka gunka**  
>_I must work. I am obliged to work._

bilga
: x1 must, is obliged to do x2 (property of x1)

>**mi curmi lo nu do citka ti**  
>_I allow you to eat this._

curmi
: x1 allows/permits x2 (possible event)

>**mi tolcru lo nu do nerkla**  
>_I forbid you to enter._

tolcru
: x1 forbids/prohibits x2 (possible event)

>**xu do stidi lo nu mi sipna**  
>_Do you suggest that I sleep?_

stidi
: x1 makes a suggestion x2 (possible event

>**mi na birti lo nu ra klama**  
>_I'm not sure if he comes._

birti
: x1 is sure that x2 (possible event) happens

>**mi senpi lo nu ra kakne lo ka limna**  
>_I doubt that he can swim._

senpi
: x1 doubts that x2 (possible event) is true

**senpi** is the same as **na'e birti**

>**mi se xanri lo nu mi pavyseljirna**  
>_I imagine myself being a unicorn. I could be a unicorn._

>**se xanri**  
>_x1 imagines x2 (possible event)_

>**xanri**  
>_x1 (possible event) is imagined by x2_

## Lesson 9. Logical conjunctions

Basic logical conjunctions in Lojban are based on 4 primitive ones: **.a**, **.e**, **.o**, **.u**. Here we'll cover them in detail.

### Logical conjunctions for nouns

Here are the conjunctions combining two words: _this_ and _that_.

- **ti .a ta** = _this and/or that_

    >**mi ba vitke lo mamta .a lo tamne**  
    >_I'll visit the mother or the cousin._  

    Note that **.a** can also be translated as _at least one of the two values_ and thus leaves open the possibility that I will get round to visiting both of them at some point.

- **ti .e ta** = _this and that_

    >**mi ralte pa gerku .e re mlatu**  
    >_I've got a dog and two cats._  
    >`I keep one dog and two cat.`

- **ti .o ta** = _either this and that, or none_

    > **mi ba vitke lo mamta .o lo tamne**  
    >_I will visit either both the mother and the cousin, or none of them_  

- **ti .u ta** = _this, and perhaps that_, _this whether or not that_

    >**mi ba vitke lo mamta .u lo tamne**  
    >_I'll visit the mother whether or not I'll visit the cousin._  

    **.u** just emphasizes that the second value does not affect the truth of the sentence.

Placing **na** before a conjunction negates what is to the left of it. Placing **nai** after a conjunction negates what is to the right of it:

- **ti .e nai ta** = _this and not that_  

    >**mi nelci la bob .e nai la alis**  
    >_I like Bob but not Alice._   
    >`I like Bob and not Alice`  

    We can also say **ti .e nai ku'i ta** (_this but not that_) adding a flavor of contrast for the second noun.

- **ti na .e ta** = _not this but that_

    > **mi nelci la alis na .e la Bob**  
    >_I don't like Alice but I do like Bob._   
    >`I like Alice not and Bob`  

    This may sound a bit weird for English speakers ("I like Alice not…") so you might prefer to swap the nouns and use **.e nai** instead: **mi nelci la bob .e nai la alis** or even **mi nelci la bob .i mi na nelci la alis** will mean the same.

- **ti na .e nai ta** = _neither this nor that (none)_

    >**mi nelci la alis na .e nai la Bob**  
    >_I don't like neither Alice nor Bob_  

Negating with other primitive conjunctions might not look intuitively usable, you can just learn them from examples:

- **ti .a nai ta** = _this if that_, _for this the exclusive condition to happen is that_

    >**mi ba vitke lo mamta .a nai lo tamne**  
    >_I will visit the mother but for that to happen I need to visit the cousin._  

    Thus **ti .a nai ta** means that **ta** is necessary (but may not be the only condition) for **ti** to be applied.

- **ti .o nai ta** = _either this or that_

      **mi ba vitke lo mamta .o nai lo tamne**  
      _I'll visit either the mother or the cousin._

      If I want to say that that I will visit either the mother or the cousin but not both, I need **.o nai** (_either/or_). It's unlike **.a** (_and/or_) where I can visit both of them.

- **ti na .u ta** = doesn't influence _(not this, but perhaps that)_
- **ti na .u nai ta** = doesn't influence _(not this, but perhaps that)_

- **ti se .u ta** = _perhaps this, and that_
- **ti se .u nai ta** = _perhaps this but not that_

**se** is used only for **.u** because in other cases it leads to no effect in meaning.

These are used for connecting nouns. For connecting parts of compound verbs we use similar conjunctions: **ja**, **je**, **jo**, **ju**. So instead of the dot (pause) we use **j** here.

It's common to use **ja**, **je**, **jo**, **ju** for connecting nouns too.

### Logical conjunctions for sentences

>**mi ralte pa gerku .e re mlatu**  
>_I've got a dog and two cats._  
>`I keep one dog and two cat.`

This is actually a contracted way of saying:

>**mi ralte pa gerku .i je mi ralte re mlatu**  
>_It is true that I have a dog. It is true that I have two cats._

**.i je** joins two sentences with a logical _and_, showing that two sentences are part of one thought and that both sentences are true.

Here are examples for other conjunctions for sentences:

>**la rome'os cu prami la djuliet .i je la djuliet cu prami la rome'os**  
>_Romeo loves Juliet <u>and</u> Juliet loves Romeo_  

means that both statements are true, i.e. Romeo and Juliet love each other.

The same is applicable to other conjunctions:

>**la rome'os cu prami la djuliet .i ja la djuliet cu prami la rome'os**  
>_Romeo loves Juliet and/or Juliet loves Romeo_

means that one of them loves the other, and perhaps both of them do.

>**la rome'os cu prami la djuliet .i jo nai la djuliet cu prami la rome'os**  
>_Either Romeo loves Juliet or Juliet loves Romeo._

Here either Romeo loves Juliet (but Juliet doesn't love him), or Juliet loves Romeo (but he doesn't love her).

>**la rome'os cu prami la djuliet .i ja nai la djuliet cu prami la rome'os**  
>_For Romeo to love Juliet it's necessary that Juliet loves Romeo._

means that if Juliet loves Romeo, he definitely loves her, but he may love her anyway (the only outcome which is impossible is that Juliet loves Romeo but he doesn't love her).

>**la rome'os cu prami la djuliet .i jo la djuliet cu prami la rome'os**  
>_Either Romeo loves Juliet and Juliet loves Romeo, or none of the two events happens._

means that if Juliet loves Romeo, he loves her, and if she doesn't love him, he doesn't love her.

>**la rome'os cu prami la djuliet .i ju la djuliet cu prami la rome'os**  
>_Romeo loves Juliet whether or not Juliet loves Romeo._

Notice how we Lojbanize the name "Romeo": combination "eo" is impossible in Lojban so we used "e'o" and added a consonant in the end for his name.

Note that **da** refers to the same entity when several sentences are connected to each other using conjunctions or with prepositions with **bo** (like **ba bo**). So if I say **da klama lo barja .i je da fenki** you can assume I'm referring to the same person in both sentences.

### Logical conjunctions for compound verbs

>**lo melbi xunre cukta**  
>_beautifully red books_

>**lo melbi je xunre cukta**  
>_beautiful and red books_

Other conjunctions also make sense:

>**mi nelci ro lo xajmi ja melbi prenu**  
>_I likes all of funny or handsome (or both) persons._

>**mi nelci ro lo xajmi jo nai melbi prenu**  
>_I likes all of either funny or beautiful persons._

this might be explained if, for example, I find the qualities of humor and good looks incompatible, i.e. a mixture of the two would be just too much.

>**mi nelci ro lo xajmi ju melbi nanmu**  
>_I likes all of funny (whether or not beautiful) persons._

And once again we shouldn't forget the difference between connecting nouns and connecting parts of compound verbs:

>**mi ba vitke pa pendo e pa speni**  
>**mi ba vitke pa pendo je pa speni**  
>_I will visit a friend and a spouse._  

The second Lojban sentence uses the common trend of using **je** for connecting nouns.

>**mi ba vitke pa pendo je speni**  
>_I will visit a friend-and-spouse_

The last Lojban sentence means that the friend is also a spouse.

### Logical conjunctions for clause tails

>**pu ku mi kelci la fudbol gi'e klama lo zdani gi'e pinxe lo ladru**  
>_I played football, went home, drank milk._

**gi'e** connects several clauses into one with some nouns shared. Look at this: It expands into **pu ku mi kelci la fudbol i je pu ku mi klama lo zdani** ... which would be lengthier.

With **gi'e** we keep the head of the clause constant, and specify nouns after each of the verb (**kelci la fudbol**, **klama lo zdani** ...)

Thus when using **gi'e** we have several main verbs in the tail, which means that it's actually several clauses (with a common head) joined together.

**gi'e** has the same final vowel as in **je** and thus means _and_.

Other conjunctions for joining clause tails:

- **gi'a** for _and/or_
- **gi'o nai** for _either ... or_
- **gi'u** for _whether or not_ etc.

So they have the same ending as conjunctions of **.a** series.

#### Prepositions in sentences with several tails

Note that prepositions in adverb form and in tense form make a difference when applied to sentences with several clauses:

- preposition in adverb form is applied to the clause to the right of it with all its tails:

    **mi na ku citka lo finpe gi'e pinxe** - _I neither eat fish nor drink._ Here, **na** is applied to **citka lo finpe gi'e pinxe**.

- preposition in tense form is applied to one clause tail only:

    **mi na citka lo finpe gi'e pinxe** - _I don't eat fish but drink._ Here, **na** is applied to **citka lo finpe** only.

### Choice questions

Another type of English _or_ can be found in questions:

>**— xu do pinxe lo tcati .o nai lo ckafi?**  
>**— je'u**  
>_— Will you drink tea or coffee?_  
>_— Yes._  

That's a weird but a perfectly reasonable answer: _Yes, I will drink tea or coffee._

Why this happens is because _or_ has several meanings in English:

1.  _A or B_ can mean _either A, or B but not both_. We use **jonai** here.
2.  _A or B_ can mean _A or B or both_. We use **ja** here.
3.  _A or B?_ can be a question meaning _select from A and B, which of them do you choose?_ We use **ji** here.

Thus in the last case we use a separate question conjunction **ji**:

>**— do pinxe lo tcati ji lo ckafi?**  
>_— Will you drink tea or coffee?_

Possible answers:

>**lo tcati .e lo ckafi**  
>_Tea and coffee._

>**lo tcati**  
>_Tea._

>**lo ckafi**  
>_Coffee._

It is also possible to use conjunctions when replying:

>**.e** — _Both_ (the first and the second item is chosen)
>**.e nai** — _The first one (tea)_ (the first but not the second one is chosen)**  
>**na .e** — _The second one (coffee)_ (not the first but the second one is chosen)_
> **na .e nai** — _Neither_ (not the first and not the second one is chosen)

You can ask questions in the same way about the other kinds of conjunctions we have looked at. The interrogative conjunction for clause tails is **gi'i**, for compound verbs - **je'i**, for sentences — **.i je'i**.

It's common to use **ji** for compound verbs too and **.i ji** for sentences.

Indirect questions are achieved by using **ji kau**:

Consider the waiter asks a visitor

>**- lo lanme ji lo bakni**  
>_- lamb or beef?_

Once the visitor answers, the waiter knows whether the visitor wants to eat lamb or beef:

>**ba lo nu le vitke cu spusku vau lo bevri cu djuno lo du'u le vitke cu djica lo ka citka lo lanme ji kau lo bakni**  
>_After the visitor replies, the waiter knows whether the visitor wants to eat lamb or beef._

### Forethought conjunctions

>**ge do gi mi**  
>_both you and I_

>**ge nai do gi mi**  
>_Not you but I_

>**ge do gi nai mi**  
>_You but not I_

>**go nai do gi mi**  
>_Either you or I_

Forethought conjunction **ge** means _and_ but it's placed before the first noun. **gi** separates the two nouns. The series is parallel to other conjunctions. It is **ga**, **ge**, **go**, **gu** and also **ge nai**, **go nai** etc. The separator **gi** is the same for all of them.

Using such conjunctions is a matter of convenience:

>**mi citka ge nai lo bakni gi lo jipci**  
>_I eat not beef but chicken._

Here, like in English _not_ is stated before the first noun.

**ge** and words in this series can still be used for connecting clauses too:

>**ge mi dansu gi mi zgipli lo pipno**  
>_I both dance and play the piano._

zgipli
: x1 plays musical instrument x2

lo pipno
: piano

>**.i ga nai pu zi carvi gi ca cilmo**  
>_If it has been raining recently, it's wet now._

## Lesson 10. Structuring text

### **ju'a** and assertions

>**le nakni cu fenki i ji'a je la alis cu jinvi lo du'u go'i**  
>_The man is crazy. And Alice thinks that too._

>**la alis cu jinvi lo du'u le nakni cu fenki**  
>_Alice has an opinion that the man is crazy._

By default the main clause of sentence asserts some information. Clauses inside places or relative clauses may not be asserted. In the last example that the man is crazy is not asserted by the speaker. It's only Alice's opinion.

The interjection **ju'a** makes the clause as asserted by the speaker. The first sentence can be thus rephrased as:

>**la alis cu jinvi lo du'u ju'a le nakni cu fenki**  
>_Alice has an opinion that the man is crazy, and it is so._

English often fails to translate this powerful **ju'a** concisely, thus the English translation doesn't follow the word order of the Lojban original.

One more example:

>**mi nelci lo nu do dansu**  
>_I like when you dance._

>**mi nelci lo nu ju'a do dansu**  
>_I like that you dance._

In the second case the speaker asserts "You dance".

### **pe'a** for metaphors, **za'e** for nonce words, **ba'e** for emphasis

>**le ninmu cu tarci pe'a i va'i ri misno**  
>_The woman is a "star". I other words, she is famous._

pe'a
: interjection: marks a construct as metaphorically used.

tarci
: x1 is a star

**tarci** denotes real stars, objects in the sky. The interjection **pe'a**

>**i ba ku mi pu viska lo cizra stuzi poi lo fagri cu nenri i mi pu klama za'e le fagrystu**  
>_And then I saw a strange place with a fire inside. I came to that (how to say) "fire-place"._

za'e
: left interjection: marks the following construct as used not in its usual meaning

Left interjections like their name suggests are put before a construct modified (whereas other interjections are put after it).

The left interjection **za'e** shows that the following construct, **le fagrystu** in this case, is made up or used not in its standard meaning, i.e. there wouldn't be need to look up in the dictionary or ask the speaker specifically about the meaning of this word since the word is used to further describe the story.

>**ba'e la alis e nai la kevin pu darxi mi**  
>_Alice, not Kevin hit me!_

>**mi djuno lo du'u ma kau pu darxi ba'e mi i ku'i mi na djuno lo du'u ma kau pu darxi do**  
>_I know who hit me. But I don't know who hit you._

ba'e
: left interjection: puts an emphasis on the following construct

To emphasize a word we would use stress in spoken English, and underlining, italics or capital letters in written English.

In Lojban we use the left interjection **ba'e**.

### Paragraphs and separating sentences

**ni'o** works exactly like **.i** but starts a new paragraph. Paragraphs are usually associated with new topics.

It is normal to use in speech only **.i** to separate sentence but you might want to use **ni'o** especially in a written text to structure it.

**ni'o

i pa nintadni pu vitke lo ctuca bu'u lo galtu bu'u lo darno cmana

\- i doi lo ctuca noi certu tavla fo la lojban vau, do skicu e'o fi mi fe lo nu fi ma kau fa la Lojban cu frica fe lo drata bangu

i le ctuca pu dunda fi le nintadni fe lo kabri be lo jinto djacu gi'e ba bo cusku di'e

\- i ca ti ko catlu le djacu gi'e skicu ri

\- i ku'i mi mo'u pinxe ri i mi na kakne lo ka catlu

\- i ki'u ma do na kakne

\- i le djacu ca pagbu lo mi xadni

ni'o

i lo mudri co'a pagbu lo zdani be da

i lo bangu poi se tadni co'a pagbu lo menli be de

i lo dirgo be lo djacu co'a pagbu lo zmadu be fi lo ka banli**  

A newbie visited a Master far high in the mountains.

\- Master, you speak fluent Lojban. Please, tell me what is the difference between Lojban and other languages.

The Master offered him a cup of spring water and then said:

\- Now look at the water and describe it.

\- But I drank it up. I can't look at it.

\- Why can't you?

\- Now it's a part of my body.

A piece of wood becomes a part of someone's house.

A language learnt becomes a part of someone's mind.

A drop of water becomes a part of something greater.

### **to … toi** for parenthetical remarks

Comments that we place inside parentheses in English text are formed using the particle **to** instead of the left parenthesis and **toi** instead of the right parenthesis:

>**ti poi to vi'onai do mi na djica lo drata toi plise cu fusra**  
>_This (no, I don't want another one!) apple is rotten._

djica
: to desire

drata
: to be different from …

plise
: x1 is an apple

fusra
: x1 rots or decays with agent x2

Such parenthetical remarks can go anywhere interjections can — meaning pretty much anywhere in a Lojban sentence. With parentheses, just like with quotes, you need to know where the parenthesis starts, and where it ends.

### Fixing errors in speech

When screwing a sentence up, knowing how to correct yourself is a good idea. You can use two words to delete your previous words:

- **si** — deletion: Deletes last word only.
- **sa** — deletion: Deletes back until next cmavo spoken.

The function of them is obvious: they delete words as if they have never been spoken. They do not work inside certain quotes (all quotes except **lu...li'u**), though, as that would leave it impossible to quote these words. Several **si** in a row deletes several words.

When you make a mistake while speaking (factual or grammatical) in English you don't normally bother to correct it even if you realize you made a mistake in the first place. That's because English is fairly redundant (for this very reason!). In English if we catch ourselves making an error, we stumble out a correction that will do the trick, without going into details like how many words should be cancelled: context usually helps us. So if I say

> _I took and read an English dictionary. Er, Lojban dictionary._

context and common sense dictate that _Lojban dictionary_ is meant to replace _English dictionary_. But what if it was meant to replace _took and read an English dictionary_? We wouldn't normally care, in natural languages.

But Lojban allows you to be more precise about what words you are correcting.

**si** erases the immediately preceding word. If you want to erase two words in a row, you say **si si** after them. So the correction above would be in Lojban

> **.i mi te benji je tadni lo glico valsi si si lojbo valsi**

valsi
: x1 is a word with the meaning x2 in language x3

The problem with **si** is, you have to count words. This can get tedious, and you shouldn't have to keep a transcript of your words when you want to correct yourself.

The other correction word Lojban offers is somewhat more helpful: **sa** takes the word following it, which starts the clause to serve as the correction. It then goes back in the sentence, looking for the last time you used a clause starting with the same word or another word of the same class (selma'o). Once it finds the last such clause, it replaces all text from that clause up to **sa** with the clause following **sa**. For example:

>**.i mi te benji gi'e tadni lo sa .i mi tadni lo lojbo valsi**

The correction following **sa** is a sentence; you know that, because the first word after **sa** is the sentence marker, **.i**. So the sentence following **sa** replaces the current sentence up to and including **sa**. Or consider:

>**.i mi mrilu fi do ca lo prulamdei sa ca lo reldei**

The correction is **ca lo reldei** — _on Tuesday_. So what it replaces is everything from the last clause beginning with **ca**: **ca lo prulamdei** — _yesterday_. The English version would be _Yesterday I mailed you... actually, it was Tuesday._

### Dealing with misunderstanding

>**— .i mi pu zi te vecnu lo flokati**  
>**— .i lo flokati ki'a**  
>_— I just bought a flokati._  
>_— Flokati, huh?_  

ki'a
: interjection inquiry: confusion about something said. "Huh? Whaat?? (confusion), pardon?"

When you don't understand what someone has just said — whether because you don't get what they were referring to, or you don't know the word, or the grammar confused you — you can repeat the word or clause you didn't get, and add **ki'a** as a plaintive request for clarification (so it's even better than _Huh?_, because you can point out exactly what made you say _Huh?_)

Here is a dialogue.

>**— mi nelci lo kalci**  
>**— ki'a ?**  
>_— I like shit._  
>_— Whaat???_  

**Note:** Since **zo** quotes any word following it — any word — it turns out that **zo ki'a** doesn't mean _zo? Huh?_ at all, but _The word **ki'a**._ To ask _zo? Huh?_, you'll have to resort to **zo zo ki'a**.

### Reverse **mi** and **do** using **ra'o**

>**- mi prami do**  
>**- go'i ra'o**  
>_- I love you._  
>_- I love you too._  

ra'o
: interjection: updates meaning from the viewpoint of the current speaker

If someone says **mi prami do** and you reply **go'i ra'o**, that reverses the pronouns **mi** and **do** so that they apply from your point of view. So every pronoun gets re-evaluated.

Compare:

>**- mi prami do**  
>**- go'i**  
>_- I love you._  
>_- You do._  

A simple **go'i** still makes **mi** refer to who used it and **do** refer to the listener of who said it.

## Lesson 11. More about pronouns

### Four meanings of "_you_" in English

We've already seen two personal pronouns, **mi** and **do**, meaning _I_ (or _me_) and _you_. However, _you_ in English can mean four different things:

1.  The one person I'm talking to.
2.  A number of people I'm talking to.
3.  The person or people I'm talking to and some other person or people.
4.  Anyone (as in _Money can't buy you love._)

Lojban gets round the confusion between (1) and (2) by using numbers. The most common way to express (2) is **ro do** = _all of you_ (or Southern U.S. _y'all_). You can also use specific numbers: **lo re do** would mean _you two_ (for example, once can start e-mails to their parents with **coi lo re do**). Notice that **re do** means _two of you_ and **re lo ci do** means _two of you three_.

You can also use numbers with **ko**, for example, **ro ko klama ti** — _All of you, get over here._

Case (3) is expressed by the pronoun **do'o** — _you and someone else_. Case (4) is completely different: it's normally expressed by **ro da** = _all **da**_ or **ro lo prenu** — _all persons_, but often you can just miss it out altogether (or place **zo'e** in that place).

### "_we_" — different ways of saying that

We've seen that the notion of _we_ isn't popular in Lojban and **mi jo'u lo pendo be mi** or **lo pendo be mi be'o jo'u mi** are used instead.

However, there are several pronouns close in meaning to _we_.

mi'o
: you and I

mi'a
: we without you

ma'a
: you and I and another/others

Some languages have such separate words for _we_. Lojban provides us with both the English _we_ and a richer set of more precise words.

And finally:

mi
: I or the speakers

**mi** can also mean _we_! Lojban makes no distinction between singular and plural by default. So if several people are speaking all together, **mi** (which refers to the one or more speakers) is perfectly correct for _we_. In practice, you'll usually get **mi** used like that when one person is presuming to speak (or more often, to write) on behalf of others.

Some examples:

>**mi prami do**  
>_I love you._

>**mi'a penmi do de'i li cy. ci**  
>_We'll meet you at three o'clock._

>**ma'a remna**  
>_We are all human._

>**mi djica lo nu do cliva**  
>_We want you to go away._

### **lo pa do** = _you one_

We know that **lo re mlatu** means _two any cats_. It's also possible to put numbers after **lo** and before pronouns.

The recommended method is turning pronouns into verbs first:

>**lo re me do ko klama ti**  
>_You two, come here._

It's possible to omit **me** in this position and say **lo re do ko klama ti** but this can lead to confusion in beginners.

### More about short relative clauses

Two constructs used in some styles:

1. Short relative clauses with a pronoun after them can be put just after **lo**:

    >**lo pe mi gerku**  
    >**lo gerku pe mi**  
    >_My dog_

2. **pe** in such cases can even be omitted:

    >**lo mi gerku**  
    >**lo gerku pe mi**  
    >_My dog_

Thus, "**lo** noun verb" is equivalent to "**lo** verb **pe** noun".

A few rules:

- if you want to use a noun converted from a verb (for example, with **lo**) or a name then it's advisable to use **pe** and put it after the noun: **lo gerku pe la .alis.** (_the Alice's dog_).
- it's okay to omit **pe** only if you use pronouns without numbers in front of them: **lo do gerku** (_my dog_) but not **lo pa do gerku** (_you one is a dog_).

It's much safer to use **pe** explicitly and put it after the noun to which it is attached: **lo gerku pe la .alis.** and **lo gerku pe mi** are most intuitive constructs.

## Lesson 12. Quotations

### Quoting text in different languages

The particle **zoi** is a quotation mark for quoting non-Lojban text. Its syntax is **zoi X. text .X**, where X is a Lojban word (called the delimiting word) which is separated from the quoted text by pauses, and which is not found in the written text or spoken phoneme stream inside that quotation. It is common, but not required, to use the name of some letter, which corresponds to the Lojban name of the language being quoted:

>**zoi gy. John is a man .gy. cu glico jufra**  
>_“John is a man” is an English sentence._

where **gy.** stands for **glico**. Other popular choices of delimiting words are **.kuot.**, a Lojban name which sounds like the English word*quote*, and the word _zoi_ itself. Another possibility is a Lojban word suggesting the topic of the quotation.

Lojban strictly avoids any confusion between things and the names of things:

>**zo .bob. cmene la bob.**  
>`The-word “Bob” is-the-name-of the-one-named Bob.`

**zo .bob.** is the word, whereas **la bob.** is the thing named by the word. The particle **la'e** and **lu'e** convert back and forth between references and their referents:

>**zo .bob. cmene la'e zo .bob.**  
>_The-word “Bob” is-the-name-of the-referent-of the-word “Bob”._

>**lu'e la bob. cmene la bob.**  
>_A-symbol-for Bob is-the-name-of Bob._

Last two examples mean the same. But this is different:

>**la bob. cu cmene la bob.**  
>_Bob is the name of Bob._

and says that Bob is both the name and the thing named, an unlikely situation. People are not names.

The particle **la'o** serves to mark non-Lojban names, for example the Linnaean binomial names (such as "Homo sapiens"), which are the internationally standardized names for species of animals and plants.

Internationally known names which can more easily be recognized by spelling rather than pronunciation, such as _Goethe_, can also appear in Lojban text with **la'o**:

>**la'o dy. Goethe .dy. cu me la'o ly. Homo sapiens .ly.**  
>_Goethe is a Homo sapiens._

Using **la'o** for all names rather than adapting them to Lojban, however, can make for a cumbersome text.

Everything expressed in text should also be expressed in speech and vice versa. Therefore, there cannot be any punctuation which is not pronounced. This means that Lojban has a wide range of words to quote other words. All Lojban convert a text into a noun.

**lu** ... **li'u** quote only text that is grammatically correct. To quote any Lojban text we use **lo'u** ... **le'u** quote instead.

>**xu lo'u je le'u lojbo sumtcita . i je'unai**  
>_Is "je" a preposition? No._

>**ma xe fanva zoi gy.What's up?.gy. la .lojban.**  
>_How to translate "What's up?" to Lojban?_

## Lesson 13. Enriching vocabulary

### New words using prepositions

Many English words correspond to word combinations in Lojban:

lo ve'i cmana
: hill (literally "mountain/hill covering little space")

lo ve'u xamsi
: ocean (literally "sea/ocean covering large space")

lo ba'o tricu
: stump of a tree (literally "no longer tree")

### **loi** and masses

**loi** makes a noun showing a mass:

lo prenu
: person, people

loi prenu
: crowd, a mass of people

>**loi prenu pu smaji**  
>_The crowd was silent._

<figure>
  <img src="https://mw.lojban.org/images/thumb/f/ff/2935770197_f39591ed59_o.jpg/96px-2935770197_f39591ed59_o.jpg" alt="loi prenu cu sruri lo jubme">
  <figcaption>
  <b>loi prenu cu sruri lo jubme</b><br/>
  <i>People surrounded the table.</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

jubme
: x1 is a table

It's not an error to use **lo** here but by using **loi** we explicitly show that it's a mass of people that surrounded the table. **loi** is a shortcut. The full form is:

>**lo gunma be lo prenu cu sruri lo jubme**  
>**loi prenu cu sruri lo jubme**  
> _The mass of people surrounded the building._

### Carrots alone and carrots together

<figure>
  <img src="https://mw.lojban.org/images/thumb/3/31/lo_kroto_noi_se_carnygau.svg/96px-lo_kroto_noi_se_carnygau.svg.png" alt="lo najgenja">
  <figcaption>
  <b>lo najgenja</b><br/>
  <i>a carrot</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Consider a sentence:

>_Three carrots weigh 60 grams._

Does it mean that each carrots weighs 60 grams or they weigh 60 grams if taken together?

In Lojban we can easily distinguish between these two cases:

>**ro lo ci najgenja cu grake li 60**  
>_Each of three carrots weigh 60 grams._

>**loi ci najgenja cu grake li 60**  
>_Three carrots weigh 60 grams in total._
>(so that every carrots weighs 20 grams on average)

najgenja
: x1 is a carrot

grake
: x1 weighs x2 grams

As you can see there is an important difference between describing one object of a mass or describing the mass as a whole.

As we already know **lo ci najgenja** just means _three carrots_:

>**ko dunda lo ci najgenja**  
>_Give me three carrots._

And

>**ko dunda pa lo ci najgenja**  
>_Give me one carrot out of those three._

### Internal prepositions

Using **be** you can attach not only the default places of verbs but even prepositions:

>**lo vi xatra be de'i li vo cu se mrilu de'i li ze**  
>_This letter, dated the 4th, was mailed on the 7th_

A date tagged with **de'i** applies only to the **xatra**. In **lo vi xatra de'i li vo cu se mrilu de'i li ze** it would apply to the whole clause, not to the letter. What we want to say is that the former date applies just to the letter, and the latter date applies to the mailing of the letter. This means that the 4th, as a date, applies only to the verb **lo xatra**, and not to the entire clause.

### Compound verbs in detail

The grouping of terms in Lojban grammar is particularly important when it comes to tanru (compound verbs). The way verbs group together in a tanru determines what that tanru means. For example,

>_bad music magazine_

has in English two interpretations: a bad magazine about music, or a magazine about bad music. In Lojban, its equivalent

>**lo xlali zgike karni**

has only the interpretation _a bad-music magazine_, because the first two verbs (_xlali zgike_ — _bad music_) group together first. So it is important to be able to modify the grouping of verbs, so that we can make sure the tanru means what we actually intend it to mean. For that reason, Lojban has a couple of mechanisms in place for making tanru group together properly.

In English we use brackets to structure the text. Likewise for tanru we use **ke' _for the left bracket and_** _ke'e_ for the right bracket.

**lo xlali ke zgike karni** means _a bad {music-magazine}_.

As you can see we separated **xlali** from the rest of the tanru and made it apply to the whole tanru. There is no need in **ke'e** in the end of the tanru since we already know that it ends here.

>**.i mi pu zi te vecnu lo xlali ke zgike karni .i to'e zanru la'o gy.Eurythmics.gy.**  
>_I just bought a bad music-magazine. It dissed the Eurythmics._

That's one way of grouping together verbs in tanru. The other way is to use a particle **bo** in a new role. When **bo** appears between two verbs, it means that those verbs group together more tightly than anything else. So an alternative way of saying _bad {music magazine}_ is

lo xlali zgike bo karni
: a bad music-magazine

**bo** here is similar to the hyphen in English translation. This means that **zgike bo karni** should count as a unit, to which **xlali** (_bad_) applies.

#### Tighter connections

So **bo** makes the connections tighter.

>**la doris e la alis onaibo la bob**  
>_Doris and (either Alice or Bob)_

**ke** can also be used with connectives (though not with sentences; they have their own kind of bracket, **tu'e ... tu'u**.) So we could also say

>**la doris e ke la alis onai la bob**  

Remember that the right bracket **ke'e** can be left out in most cases without changing the meaning (like in this case).

Forethought conjunction are also used a lot since they can eliminate the need in right brackets:

>**ge la doris gi go nai la alis gi la bob**  
>_Doris and either Alice or Bob_  

and

>**go nai ge la doris gi la alis gi la bob**  
>_Either Doris and Alice, or Bob_  

We don't need **bo** or **ke** with forethought conjunctions.

### **co** for changing the order in compound verbs

There is another way of restructuring compound verbs.

>**mi fanva se jibri**  
>_I'm a professional translator_

jibri
: x1 is a job of x2

dotybau
: x1 is German used by x2 to say x3

glibau
: x1 is English used by x2 to say x3

If I wanted to say that I'm a professional translator from English to German, I could mess around with **be**, **bei**:

>**mi fanva be lo dotybau bei lo glibau be'o se jibri**  
>_I'm a professional translator from English to German_

The fact that it was a compound verb could quickly be lost in speech due to the complicated structure of the sentence. Here, we can use the word **co**:

**co** — inverts the compound verb, making the rightmost verb word modify the leftmost instead of the other way around. Any previous noun fills the modified, any following noun fills the modifier.

>**mi se jibri co fanva lo dotybau lo glibau**

It is the same clause as the previous Lojban one, but much more easy to understand. Notice that any noun before the compound verb fills **se jibri**, while any following it only fills the modifying verb: **fanva**.

The strength by which two verbs are bound together with **co** is very weak – even weaker than normal compound verb grouping without any grouping words. This makes sure that, in a co-construct, the leftmost verb word is always the verb being modified, and the rightmost always modifies, even if any of those parts are compound verbs. This makes a co-construct easy to understand:

> **ti pelxu plise co kukte**

is read as **ti (pelxu plise) co kukte**, which is the same as **ti kukte pelxu bo plise**. This also means that a **ke … ke'e** cannot encompass a **co**.

However, **gi'e**, **gi'a** etc. bind even looser than **co**. This is in order to totally avoid confusion about which verb word binds to which in a **gi'e**. The answer is simple: **gi'e** never emcompasses any verb groups.

How can you express "I am an important American buyer of computers" using a **co**?

Answer: **mi skami te vecnu co vajni merko**

If it's of any use, this is the list of different kind of verb word groupers ranked by strength:

1.  **bo** and **ke … ke'e**
2.  Logical connectives other than **gi'e** series
3.  not using grouping words
4.  **co**
5.  **gi'e** series (clause-tail afterthought connectives)

## Non-standard connective system

Some people for connecting nouns instead of

- **a**, **e**, **o**, **u**

use

- **ja**, **je**, **jo**, **ju**

That is instead of

>**mi e do nelci lo plise**  
>_I like apples, and you like apples._

they say

>**mi je do nelci lo plise**  
>_I like apples, and you like apples._

This is a non-standard approach. People use this style because in it there are fewer conjunctions to remember.

But you should be careful not to forget **lo** or numbers to form nouns: **mi nelci lo plise je jisra** would mean _I like something that is an apple (or apples) and is juice_ (?!)

The correct sentence uses **lo** to form every noun:

>**mi nelci lo plise je lo jisra**  
>_I like apples and juice._

In standard approach the speaker uses a separate conjunction **e** when connecting nouns, and it's easier to see the difference and the correct meaning:

>**mi nelci lo plise .e lo jisra**  
>_I like apples and juice._
